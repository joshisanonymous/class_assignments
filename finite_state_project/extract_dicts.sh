# This script extracts all words from eng.dict and fra.dict, tags
# them using TreeTagger, then outputs the following each to their own
# intermediate lexc file with the LEXICON header that they belong
# under included:
#
# English verbs, English non-verbs, French verbs of each class,
# and French non-verbs.
#
# The point is to manually copy the results to the core lexc file
# and, in the process, to check for obvious issues (e.g., remove
# <unknown> and irregular verbs like Ãªtre placed in non-verbs).
