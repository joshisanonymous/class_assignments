    There were several passages in the above transcription that were phonologically interesting. Word-final alveolar stops in words such as \lexi{thought} were rarely released. In this case, the following word \lexi{for} began with a consonant, but even in a series of words like \lexi{meant and}, the /t/ was realized as [t̚]. Some of these cases led to the tap [ɾ] being used if that sound was intervocalic, such as in \lexi{so that I would}, transcribed as [soʊ ðæɾ aɪ wʊd̚], with an [ɾ] at the end of \lexi{that}.

    The /t/s in words like \lexi{tried} and \lexi{trance}, where followed by /ɹ/, were also at least retracted to post-alveolar positions, though it is possible that they were fully affricated as [tʃ]. This occurred even if the cluster was preceded by /s/ as in \lexi{street}, which also had a retracted [s̠] that for some reason was clearly different from the non-retracted /s/ in \lexi{started}.

    In unstressed syllables, /ə/ and /ɪ/ were often not distinct, as in the \lexi{-ed} of \lexi{started}. In some words, this was particularly hard to transcribe, as in \lexi{saying}, which I transcribed as [seɪən]. In reality, it seems equally likely that the transcription could have been [seɪɪn] or [seɪn̩]. On a related note, \lexi{-ing} words were basically always pronounced with voiced alveolar nasals instead of velar, hence \lexi{saying} was not [seɪŋ].

    Words like \lexi{trance} and \lexi{answer} were very difficult to pronounce without an epenthesized [t] between the /n/ and /s/. However, this was not an issue at the word boundary in \lexi{couldn't see}, transcribed as [kʰʊd̚n si]. It is difficlt to know if this is due to the word boundary itself or the /t/ deletion.

    There was also an unexpected aspiration in the /p/ in the word \lexi{complete}, realized as [kʰəmpʰlit̠̚]. It makes sense in that /l/ is fairly sonorant, but it was unexpected nonetheless. Compared to the aspiration in \lexi{pit} and the lack of aspiration in \lexi{spit}, it was somewhere in between.

    Finally, both tokens of \lexi{question} were pronounced with [ʃtʃ], as in [kwɛʃtʃən]. From what I understand, for some speakers, this is a very unusual combination of sounds.
