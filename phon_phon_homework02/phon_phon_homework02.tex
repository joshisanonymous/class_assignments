    Alveolar stops unreleased at the end of most words, even if there is a following vowel. /t/ typically seems to become [ɾ] before a following vowel, but not /d/
    The [t] in tried and trance is at least retracted, but might also become the affricate [tʃ].
      The [s] in street also sounds retracted compared to started
        In unstressed syllables, ə and ɪ are often not distinct, as in the ed in started
          This is particularly hard to transcribe n saying, which almost sounds simply like [seɪn]
    Very difficult to say words like trance or answer without inserting a [t] between the [n] and [s], but not at a syllable break as in couldn't see
    Ing words are basically always pronounced with alveolar nasals.
    The aspiration in complete is certainly there, despite a following [l] instead of a vowel, but it's not as significant as when followed by a vowel. It's definitely not unaspirated in the way it would be in spit, though.
    Both tokens of question had ʃtʃ, which I've recently learned is unusual for some speakers.
