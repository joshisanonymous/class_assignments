sorry
but
this
guys
an
idiot
unlike
the
average
japanese
speaker
the
average
english
speaker
wouldnt
know
what
sesquipedalian
meant
maybe
not
but
we
sure
would
know
what
polysyllabic
meant
when
he
tries
to
knock
english
and
our
education
system
he
is
diverting
your
attention
from
the
fact
that
we
have
the
largest
vocabulary
of
any
known
language
on
the
planet
thus
we
are
apt
to
not
know
all
words
as
far
as
teaching
root
words
in
school
we
do
that
however
if
you
wanted
to
be
thorough
youd
have
to
include
german
italian
french
among
others
im
not
saying
its
a
bad
idea
but
it
isnt
the
most
plausible
thing
and
as
far
as
it
being
easier
than
your
native
language
who
are
you
trying
to
kid
i
think
he
should
just
go
back
to
akihabara
in
his
evangelion
costume
an
nescis
mi
fili
quantilla
sapientia
mundus
regatur
so
does
s
include
groucho
marx
i
think
there
must
be
some
misunderstanding
on
the
way
from
that
graduate
student
to
that
blog
to
here
an
educated
person
in
a
society
that
uses
tin
cans
will
know
how
to
say
read
and
write
the
term
for
tin
can
in
his
or
her
native
language
and
writing
system
a
decorative
poster
is
a
different
matter
im
sure
i
couldnt
read
an
11th
century
manuscript
in
old
english
either
but
chinese
people
do
know
how
to
read
and
write
their
own
language
its
not
all
decorative
or
magic
to
read
chinese
one
must
know
between
3000
and
5000
characters
for
japanese
its
more
like
2000bare
minimum
to
4
or
5000
though
in
both
cases
word
lovers
scientists
historians
etc
will
know
a
lot
more
most
japanese
characters
kanji
borrowed
right
from
chinese
hanzi
are
identical
or
similar
visually
and
in
meaning
if
not
pronunciation
it
sounds
like
a
lot
but
you
said
youre
not
aiming
for
learning
the
whole
language
one
or
two
hundred
characters
not
for
toddlers
but
gradeschoolage
kids
is
a
fun
taste
and
probably
about
as
useful
as
knowing
how
to
sound
out
cyrillic
or
greek
letters
when
you
dont
actually
know
the
language
youre
reading
my
vote
is
if
youre
not
aiming
for
proficiency
in
any
one
language
throw
in
a
little
bit
of
everything
i
agree
wholeheartedly
that
exposure
like
this
could
only
nourish
curiosity
i
do
wonder
though
how
kids
not
often
exposed
to
native
models
will
be
expected
to
be
fluent
in
4
or
5
languages
by
the
time
theyre
teenagers
maybe
if
they
happen
to
be
geniuses
and
inclined
to
language
learning
or
if
they
live
in
a
highly
multilingual
culture
or
if
their
parents
are
both
polyglots
so
stax
youd
definitely
fit
into
that
first
group
i
mentioned
and
yes
you
make
a
good
point
teaching
nonnative
speakers
of
english
ive
had
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
undoing
perceived
pronunciation
based
on
english
orthography
ive
seen
it
even
in
advanced
speakers
they
still
want
to
pronounce
spelled
out
sounds
that
arent
there
oh
okay
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
something
much
worse
than
that
scribd
sends
10
of
their
profits
to
the
punch
a
baby
a
day
foundation
or
something
like
that
thanks
i
think
this
is
hardly
the
case
i
am
more
likely
to
use
th
before
a
vowel
i
am
probably
most
likely
to
use
th
in
general
but
i
think
if
there
is
any
difference
it
is
more
semantic
than
a
phonetic
process
i
think
thi
can
stress
the
fact
that
that
is
the
specific
thing
you
are
talking
about
the
table
whereas
th
lacks
that
emphasis
of
the
individual
thing
just
the
table
id
say
no
when
you
move
your
hand
is
this
something
that
requires
language
language
is
even
more
abstracted
though
id
argue
it
might
be
silly
to
discuss
the
brain
consciousness
using
terms
like
operating
system
were
not
even
sure
how
our
consciousness
works
but
im
fairly
sure
were
not
a
von
neumann
architecture
for
instance
discussing
similarities
between
how
computers
work
and
ourselves
might
not
be
very
useful
australians
say
apericot
oh
and
columbus
oh
i
think
the
interaction
of
form
and
content
has
the
potential
to
communicate
a
great
deal
more
than
a
single
borrowed
word
or
syntax
that
said
languages
will
continue
to
borrow
and
assimilate
to
meet
their
own
needs
and
as
previous
posters
have
pointed
out
it
may
be
the
loss
of
culture
ie
the
loss
of
need
for
these
dying
language
elements
thats
most
disappointing
geographic
and
political
boundaries
still
remain
driving
forces
in
linguistic
diversity
but
with
the
acceleration
and
penetration
of
communication
technology
that
may
be
a
diminishing
influence
wait
a
few
centuries
until
spacecolonization
it
may
turn
the
tide
for
languages
until
then
linguists
will
take
the
role
of
frantic
historian
edit
spelling
with
the
advent
of
the
printing
press
we
got
stuck
with
these
rather
kooky
spellings
that
would
have
probably
otherwise
sorted
themselves
out
over
time
like
this
though
the
tough
cough
and
hiccough
plough
him
through
robert
a
heinlein
woah
theres
actually
people
on
reddit
interested
in
this
i
thought
i
was
the
only
one
showoff
hmm
it
may
just
be
that
the
use
of
pronouns
makes
the
structure
sound
more
weird
and
noteworthy
not
sure
another
thought
is
that
iif
im
recalling
correctly
some
languages
mark
the
patient
of
causatives
in
a
similar
way
with
prepositions
or
cases
meaning
on
perhaps
that
can
rationalize
the
on
bit
im
curious
why
you
would
expect
it
to
have
poor
filler
lexicon
though
and
not
because
i
intend
to
later
criticize
your
assumption
which
is
i
hope
not
how
that
question
seems
does
it
just
seem
that
agglutinative
languages
may
have
less
need
to
pause
and
go
um
yes
precisely
i
started
wondering
to
what
extent
morphology
governs
the
formation
and
usage
of
filler
words
and
my
first
thought
was
that
there
might
be
a
relationship
to
the
degree
of
fusion
its
easy
to
see
that
this
is
wrong
in
the
general
case
but
i
only
had
positive
examples
for
the
idea
that
it
might
drop
off
sharply
towards
the
agglutinative
side
of
the
spectrum
there
are
also
a
good
amount
of
particlesenclitics
that
you
can
stick
on
the
end
of
nouns
or
verbs
for
emphasis
or
to
provide
a
sense
that
something
is
opposite
what
someone
might
expect
but
those
sorta
fall
outside
of
the
category
of
umfiller
words
thinking
of
russian
they
may
be
more
equivalent
to
or
or
something
like
that
ah
cool
ive
seen
this
in
tatar
but
oddly
enough
it
often
resorts
to
analytic
constructions
for
that
the
turkish
analogues
are
more
synthetic
but
i
dont
know
turkish
well
enough
to
say
if
they
can
be
used
in
a
filler
sense
i
suspect
that
if
anything
those
are
probably
more
like
the
modal
particles
in
southern
german
dialects
halt
fei
eh
etc
which
have
a
unique
semantic
function
and
rigid
morphology
i
dont
know
why
i
find
mirativityevidentiality
so
damn
interesting
lack
of
exposure
probably
as
for
those
particlesenclitics
northern
smi
related
to
finnish
more
distantly
than
estonian
but
much
much
closer
than
hungarian
might
have
even
more
of
those
than
finnish
not
sure
right
now
just
curious
is
there
a
common
explanation
for
why
the
uralic
languages
are
so
fragmented
its
a
lot
of
cool
grammar
in
one
place
so
i
tend
to
end
up
reading
up
on
individual
ones
now
and
again
it
seems
like
theres
always
a
sentence
along
the
lines
of
x
a
distant
relative
of
y
is
a
member
of
group
g
the
members
of
which
are
mostly
not
mutually
intelligible
the
online
dictionary
i
use
most
often
isnt
even
a
dictionary
per
se
its
wikipedia
just
look
up
a
word
in
the
source
language
and
switch
to
the
target
language
the
caveat
is
that
this
is
only
useful
between
languages
that
have
a
lot
of
articles
i
translate
between
enpl
and
for
words
and
phrases
that
arent
often
found
in
normal
dictionaries
nah
estonian
isnt
as
hard
as
this
article
makes
it
out
to
be
the
only
real
irregularities
are
found
in
the
genitive
and
partitive
and
occasionally
the
illative
but
1
the
rest
of
them
are
all
formed
regularly
from
the
genitive
so
if
you
know
that
then
theyre
just
suffixes
and
2
there
is
no
grammatical
gender
in
estonian
to
worry
about
many
ie
languages
have
three
genders
plus
cases
but
in
estonian
its
just
the
singular
and
plural
plus
estonian
is
super
easy
to
read
stress
on
the
first
syllable
and
read
as
pronounced
the
word
order
is
also
more
similar
to
english
most
of
the
time
in
complex
sentences
what
makes
estonian
hard
is
that
its
hard
to
find
places
to
use
it
but
then
again
its
also
a
cheaper
country
than
many
in
europe
and
its
still
easy
to
find
people
that
dont
speak
a
word
of
english
which
makes
it
much
easier
to
practice
david
graddol
has
written
some
interesting
stuff
on
global
english
and
the
impact
globalization
is
having
on
dialect
convergence
particularly
among
l2
speakers
you
could
check
it
out
the
italian
of
that
is
voi
so
no
that
isnt
used
when
adressing
a
group
though
and
i
say
this
as
someone
who
uses
a
secondperson
plural
pronoun
it
feels
very
odd
to
say
you
so
it
would
be
natural
for
someone
whos
used
to
using
such
a
pronoune
to
search
for
another
one
i
added
a
request
for
a
comparison
here
hopefully
someone
with
good
knowledge
of
both
will
write
an
informative
comparison
yes
but
most
of
his
research
is
in
fields
other
than
linguistics
this
is
going
to
quickly
morph
into
a
list
of
every
linguist
anyone
has
ever
heard
of
but
i
still
feel
compelled
to
add
a
few
more
semantics
is
pretty
underrepresented
richard
montague
okay
technically
i
guess
he
was
in
a
philosophy
department
but
hes
the
single
most
important
figure
in
modern
semantics
hans
kamp
discourse
representation
theory
irene
heim
the
leibniz
to
kamps
newton
in
dynamic
semantics
jon
barwise
generalized
quantifiers
situation
semantics
okay
he
was
a
logician
but
still
id
probably
also
add
folks
like
larry
horn
and
david
dowty
on
the
cognitive
linguistics
side
gilles
fauconnier
is
pretty
awesome
outside
of
semantics
john
goldsmith
autosegmental
phonology
john
haj
ross
island
constraints
you
know
before
you
start
cutting
away
you
might
want
to
think
about
grouping
them
by
subdisciplines
as
a
sociolinguist
ive
read
very
little
in
semantics
syntax
computational
historical
phonetics
and
phonology
i
dont
think
its
that
there
are
necessarily
less
essential
names
i
think
its
youve
just
got
really
good
coverage
for
this
fields
incredible
breadth
from
a
brief
look
at
the
wikipedia
article
so
i
could
be
wildly
wrong
here
onomatopoeias
imitate
actual
sounds
eg
splash
vroom
whereas
ideophones
represent
other
sensations
as
in
the
example
of
a
rabbit
going
hippetyhop
which
represents
the
impression
you
get
when
observing
the
rabbits
loping
gait
language
acquisition
begins
in
the
womb
with
that
most
of
the
things
we
learn
as
far
as
language
and
dialect
occur
in
the
very
early
years
of
our
lives
most
of
the
time
spent
in
the
first
five
years
of
our
life
is
surrounded
by
the
language
and
dialect
of
our
parentsfamily
by
about
six
years
children
are
beginning
to
master
the
phonological
characteristics
that
they
are
exposed
to
i
dont
know
many
six
year
olds
consistently
chatting
on
xbox
live
or
the
internet
if
any
at
all
from
age
six
to
ten
is
when
their
phonology
seems
to
be
made
more
concrete
its
not
to
say
that
they
cant
accommodate
to
other
dialects
but
there
is
a
more
deep
rooted
base
from
which
they
stem
ive
found
online
translators
to
still
be
quite
lacking
even
with
my
limited
usage
of
them
theyve
gotten
100x
better
in
the
past
few
years
but
there
are
still
enough
errors
for
it
to
cause
confusion
at
times
the
other
big
problem
is
expressions
or
colloquial
usage
of
words
googles
database
of
text
can
help
with
this
but
it
only
takes
a
few
mistakes
to
really
change
the
meaning
if
i
say
that
someone
has
kicked
the
bucket
do
i
mean
that
someone
literally
did
that
or
that
someone
died
if
youre
translating
between
cultures
where
that
expression
doesnt
exist
it
becomes
even
more
difficult
we
often
only
know
the
correct
meaning
based
on
context
and
if
youve
ever
tried
playing
around
with
computer
ai
systems
like
alice
or
smarter
child
then
you
know
that
context
is
the
easiest
way
to
trip
up
a
computer
haha
based
on
what
i
can
understand
of
them
these
stock
photographs
pick
really
odd
writing
samples
maybe
we
can
work
together
to
translate
them
all

6
this
is
really
the
kicker
and
quite
interesting
as
chinese
is
the
language
i
have
the
most
familiarity
with
i
looked
at
this
one
a
little
more
closely
at
first
glance
it
is
of
all
things
the
lords
prayer
written
in
a
somewhat
modernized
classical
chinese
however
all
overt
references
to
god
have
been
removed
this
bears
only
faint
resemblance
to
any
of
the
lords
prayer
variants
discussed
here
for
instance
from
the
sample
you
from
heaven
desire
that
your
name
will
be
respected
by
men
compare
this
to
from
wikipedia
our
celestial
father
we
desire
that
men
all
respect
your
name
and
render
it
holy
this
really
is
quite
odd
i
can
find
no
other
references
to
this
particular
version
of
the
lords
prayer
anywhere
on
the
internet

this
is
an
excerpt
from
the
illuminated
manuscript
the
st
petersburg
gospels
in
the
eighth
century
specifically
it
is
john
11in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
this
is
clearly
not
high
classical
latin
the
subject
of
the
blurb
below
the
picture

again
we
simply
have
the
alphabet
anyhow
any
insight
others
could
give
into
the
other
bizarre
scripts
would
be
welcome
as
a
final
note
where
are
the
japanese
alphabets
on
this
list
also
no
bantu
languages
swahili
is
a
gaping
omission
haha
incidentally
i
just
realized
that
this
is
a
picture
of
baba
yetu
the
text
used
in
the
song
for
civilization
iv
that
sounds
to
me
like
what
she
means
have
you
heard
it
used
that
way
before
also
wrong
words
and
misspelled
words
but
hes
a
pop
star
so
he
gets
a
pass
a
contracted
form
of
mathematics
which
is
plural
i
have
tried
for
30
minutes
and
decided
it
will
be
faster
to
find
an
icelander
to
speak
for
me
the
other
is
just
kinda
interesting
if
you
like
etymology
thats
your
problem
there
seeing
hanja
as
just
interesting
etymology
its
much
more
deeply
rooted
than
that
do
you
think
languages
didnt
exist
before
writing
systems
or
that
illiterate
people
cant
speak
a
language
fluently
sure
they
can
native
speakers
that
have
been
brought
up
with
the
language
since
childhood
for
those
learning
it
as
an
l2
theres
no
reason
to
try
the
same
route
a
good
point
it
could
also
be
that
some
of
the
socially
awkwardinept
seek
out
subjects
such
as
linguistics
to
help
with
their
awkwardness
this
is
a
bit
too
late
peterson
has
already
created
the

much

do
they
have
with
earth
do
they
have
media
of
any
kind
movies
music
written
materials
do
the
founding
members
speak
one
language
two
or
multiple
ones
do
their
education
levels
push
them
toward
linguistic
prescriptivism
or
are
they
uninterested
in
these
matters
what
is
their
educational
system
like
how
big
is
the
colony
lets
assume
total
isolation
and
no
earth
media
lets
assume
everyone
speaks
one
language
going
in
and
that
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
members
come
from
the
same
class
cultural
background
etc
and
speak
more
or
less
the
same
way
i
would
guess
at
least
four
or
five
generations
this
would
give
time
for
the
founding
members
to
die
out
removing
the
primary
earth
language
input
conservatively
six
or
seven
meaning
that
virtually
no
one
with
any
contact
with
the
founding
generation
remained
alive
any
change
to
the
above
conditions
would
likely
extend
this
time
frame
there
are
also
internal
social
issues
to
consider
consider
most
creoles
to
speakers
of
the
socalled
substrate
language
english
for
jamaican
creole
french
for
hatian
creole
etc
the
most
comprehensible
form
of
the
language
is
called
the
acrolect
the
basilect
usually
the
more
common
form
of
the
language
and
often
somewhat
unfairly
associated
with
lower
classes
is
less
intelligible
to
substrate
language
speakers
returning
to
the
space
colony
there
might
be
a
formal
variant
of
the
language
that
develops
intelligible
to
earthlings
coexisting
with
an
unintelligible
variety
spoken
at
home
on
the
streets
or
among
friends
space
colony
members
would
understand
both
but
earthlings
would
only
understand
one
are
they
separate
languages
this
is
a
question
for
the
philosophers
assume
they
are
the
basilect
will
probably
develop
in
fewer
generations
but
not
be
spoken
so
widely
so
your
question
has
a
range
of
outcomes
then
there
are
issues
of
languages
spoken
on
earth
how
fast
do
they
change
in
comparison
to
the
space
language
maybe
a
particularly
conservative
variety
of
the
founding
language
would
remain
mutually
intelligible
with
the
space
language
long
after
other
varieties
moved
on
tldr
language
change
is
really
badly
understood
and
there
are
shittons
of
factors
at
work
lets
choose
a
group
of
people
and
test
this
empirically
what
are
you
serious
am
i
missing
something
completely
i
use
the
all
the
time
thanks
for
the
tip
looked
up
dara
obriain
and
hes
pretty
good
well
any
bushism
only
refers
to
specific
stupid
things
said
by
bush
if
itd
entered
the
popular
vocabulary
as
anything
said
that
sounded
stupid
then
it
might
be
more
similar
so
if
he
is
to
be
in
it
or
to
be
of
it
or
it
is
in
it
or
if
it
is
in
it
he
is
to
be
in
it
is
ma
yeah
that
sort
of
recursion
works
fine
essentially
youve
got
a
rule
s
if
s
s
so
long
as
you
can
expand
s
into
a
two
letter
sentence
the
length
is
clearly
unbounded
thats
true
in
most
languages
there
will
be
terms
that
you
would
only
understand
if
you
were
familiar
with
the
culture
or
history
that
just
came
into
existence
thanks
to
the
morphemes
of
the
language
shudder
eh
quebec
french
has
a
lot
of
anglicisms

theyre

the

the

we
could
equally
say
while
the

with

the
gunshot
wound
is
generally
blamed
for
his
death
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
while
there
can
be
an
implication
that
the
actor
was
personally
responsible
theres
also
the
implication
that
it
hasnt
been
proven
which
i
think
is
why
we
are
perfectly
able
and
willing
to
use
it
to
say
suspected
to
be
the
cause
of
how
is
it
more

just
seems

there
are
two

which
is

i
cant
speak
for
all
linguists
and
im
just
a
linguistics
student
but
it
does
not
trouble
me
personally
that
documented
languages
are
dying
to
me
a
language
is
data
that
is
useful
in
shaping
theories
of
syntax
phonology
etc
sometimes
very
strange
things
will
happen
in
only
one
language
in
the
world
and
the
fact
that
it
can
happen
is
very
important
because
someone
may
have
previously
claimed
that
its
absence
is
universal
and
is
therefore
prohibited
by
some
fundamental
tenet
of
human
language
for
example
we
might
not
know
that
the
bilabial
trill
can
be
phonemic
or
that
ovs
objectverbsubject
can
be
a
primary
word
order
a
claimed
linguistic
universal
for
quite
a
long
time
was
that
there
must
be
at
least
one
vowel
in
every
prosodic
word
until
the
salish
languages
were
documented
which
can
have
words
like
tsktskts
he
arrived
it
does
trouble
me
when
undocumented
languages
die
because
that
data
is
now
gone
forever
which
is
why
there
is
still
a
huge
need
for
field
linguists
to
go
out
and
document
every
language
they
can
get
their
hands
on
i
have
found
that
when
presented
with
a
seemingly
intractable
problem
in
analysis
the
answer
is
always
to
get
more
data
then
everything
becomes
clear
of
course
language
is
an
inextricable
part
of
culture
and
many
cultural
groups
wish
to
preserve
or
in
some
cases
revive
their
ancestral
language
thats
completely
fine
with
me
but
honestly
i
dont
care
as
an
aside
while
nobody
uses
the
phonetic
pronunciation
of
comfortable
ill
be
damned
if
ask
and
ax
merge
same
with
plum
and
plumb
while
were
on
the
subject
i
made
myself
a
deck
of
flashcards
with
vocabulary
holepunched
them
and
attached
them
to
a
key
ring
for
my
russian
german
and
italian
classes
then
i
flipped
through
them
every
day
on
the
bus
probably
20
min
each
way
alternating
my
source
and
target
languages
i
also
got
my
roommate
to
quiz
me
out
of
ordershe
ended
up
able
to
read
russian
fairly
fluently
as
a
result
if
youre
any
good
at
setting
words
to
music
you
can
memorize
grammar
according
to
a
particular
melody
i
still
have
a
set
of
russian
prefixes
memorized
to
the
chorus
of
billy
joels
piano
man
and
its
been
almost
five
years
china

wo

im
hoping
the
other

werent
as
bad
accent
discrimination
may
be
the
most
mortifying
in
part
because
it
is
still
widely
accepted
in
our
society
cause
its
fun
and
i
mean
you
know
what
they
say
about
people
who
monophthongize
a
interesting
it
seems
like
a
result
of
her
vocalization
while
singing
rather
than
an
affectation
for
lip
synching
it
isnt
necessarily
true
that
there
are
an
infinite
number
of
values
between
any
two
discrete
number
terms
practically
it
might
be
for
this
particular
consideration
but
i
dont
believe
this
is
the
actual
case
using
the
color
example
to
highlight
this
there
arent
an
infinite
number
of
colors
that
the
eye
can
distinguish
if
you
are
just
talking
about
math
it
really
depends
on
what
set
of
numbers
your
working
with
reals
yes
naturals
no
im
studying
it
at
michigan
state
university
this
is
my
second
ever
linguistics
class
the
last
of
which
i
took
in
fall
2009
and
it
was
a
beginners
course
im
taking
a
syntax
class
at
the
same
time
right
now
as
semantics
and
since
they
tend
to
contradict
each
other
a
lot
it
gets
really
confusing
on
vinyl
i
lived
in
vancouver
for
five
years
most
of
the
people
i
know
where
either
from
ontario
bc
alberta
or
the
yukon
in
my
recollection
it
was
mostly
people
on
the
provinces
on
the
atlantic
coast
that
do
this
canadians
are
very
aware
of
this
phenomenon
the
only
shibboleth
i
found
for
people
from
bc
vs
washington
state
was
pasta
the
canadian
a
sounds
sounds
nasalized
and
seems
like
it
is
produced
further
back
then
the
a
i
produce
i
am
terrible
with
phonology
but
this
is
my
best
attempt
at
describing
it
wellthe
military
has
a
few
things
you
could
be
an
fao
foreign
area
officer
or
army
civil
affairs
officer
dont
go
in
as
an
enlisted
linguist
youll
be
stuck
in
one
or
two
languages
over
your
career
and
rarely
will
be
in
a
place
you
can
use
that
language
with
native
speakers
then
theres
the
state
department
and
foreign
ngos
you
wont
necessarily
need
the
language
but
youll
get
places
relatedly
i
have
a
friend
pursuing
her
phd
in
international
affairs
currently
and
she
has
been
all
over
the
worldeven
as
an
undergrad
id
check
out
some
expat
forums
online
and
see
what
these
guys
do
i
know
you
can
say
it
work
for
raytheon
and
go
wherever
the
us
military
isso
many
many
countries
i
just
dont
know
what
the
actual
fullcivilians
are
doing
easiest
way
as
stated
elsewhere
though
is
as
an
english
teacher
i
have
friends
trying
to
get
me
to
go
back
to
several
countries
for
that
are
you
referring
to
the
story
that
homosexuals
were
burnt
i
dont
think
thats
accurate
that
im
saying
that
this
makes
faggot
an
inoffensive
word
you
understand
my
only
qualification
is
that
i
dated
a
syntactician
for
many
years
but
my
argument
in
favor
of
not
rejecting
sapirwhorf
out
of
hand
is
the
use
of
language
to
get
a
handle
on
abstraction
for
example
jargon
in
a
specialized
field
allows
terms
with
complex
meaning
and
associations
to
be
discussed
and
manipulated
and
further
abstracted
almost
like
algebraic
symbols
in
a
complicated
equation
that
themselves
stand
in
for
complicated
equations
the
abstraction
of
that
jargon
layer
enables
ideas
and
discussions
among
specialists
that
would
be
impossible
for
laymen
unfamiliar
with
the
terms
the
really
tough
thing
for
me
the
only
sound
that
ive
tried
that
i
know
i
cant
do
right
is
to
lose
the
aspiration
on
my
p
t
and
k
sounds
in
english
we
always
have
a
little
wisp
of
air
following
these
consonants
that
other
languages
do
not
i
have
a
seriously
hard
time
losing
it
oh
yeah
i
can
also
make
the
sounds
in
the
indian
languages
kanada
and
malayalam
even
without
the
bunny
i
would
say
that
someone
made
a
beer
run
there
are
a
number
of
them
but
a
good
example
is
that
the
compositional
meaning
of
adjectivey
things
is
conjunctive
not
disjunctive
for
example
brown
cow
can
mean
brownandcow
among
the
other
noncompositional
meanings
of
chocolaterootbeerfloat
and
brandofyogurt
but
it
cant
mean
brownorcow
if
you
try
to
teach
this
to
kids
or
adults
they
just
cant
learn
it
without
conscious
effort
unlike
say
the
meaning
of
glorp
to
mean
beigy
green
there
are
lots
of
other
examples
in
this
domain
of
linguistics
as
well
as
in
others
like
syntax
but
i
think
this
one
is
relatively
simple
there
is
a
site
like
this
for
books
i
do
the
phonetic
way
but
largely
arbitrarily
sometimes
i
would
pick
a
spelling
that
looks
closer
to
its
latin
counterpart
for
aesthetic
id
use
for
both
je
sounds
and
ay
sounds
but
to
substitute
latin
e
when
its
a
schwa
also
as
tion
so
interpretation
would
look
like
i
have
several
ways
to
transliterate
th
sound
mostly
with
if
in
front
or
elsewhere
when
appropriate
over
the
months
the
arbitrary
choices
somehow
made
a
consistent
whole
and
my
transliteration
of
any
given
english
word
is
pretty
much
stabilized
i
enjoyed
watching
that
thanks
for
sharing
great
lesson
on
the
shifting
pronunciation
of
the
english
language
too

if

look
at

since
they
have
a
ton
of
specific
ones
the
above
as
well
as
stuff
like
slapping
various

various

wind
some
of
which
arent
even
associated
with
sounds
in
other
places
especially
the
one
for

when
teaching
students
about

stress
tone
and
how
it
changes
meaning
i
use
the

i
asked
you
to
buy
me
a
bunch
of
roses
but
i
like
your
sentence
better
i
second
the
ama
request
im
question
iirc
theyre
designed
to
work
with
a
specific
accent
right
is
there
like
a
backup
for
getting
calls
from
wildly
different
accents
the
software
was
designed
for
i
take
it
the
person
would
be
out
of
luck
i
dont
find
it
ugly
but
very
jarring
none
of
the
englishlooking
letters
have
anywhere
near
their
equivalent
phonetic
values
eg
a
go
b
y
c
tli
d
a
e
g
j
gu
p
li
r
e
and
s

i
w
la

no
oo
i
wonder
how
biliterate
englishcherokee
handle
all
these
faux
ami
letters
especially
in
early
literacy
sure
doppelgnger
letters
exist
in
greek
and
cyrillic
too
but
not
nearly
to
the
same
degree
of
course
its
explained
by
their
being
akin
to
the
latin
alphabet
but
still
must
be
a
pain
on
cherokee
kids
trying
to
learn
this
system
and
those
lucky
people
dont
have
to
check
any
boxes
that
was
the
immediate
topic
which
doesnt
help
anyone
else
it
does
but
only
if
you
go
to
system
preferences
and
enable
keyboard
navigation
for
form
elements
other
than
only
textboxes
which
is
the
system
default
unfortunately
checkboxes
arent
default
at
least
on
firefoxsafari
in
osx
on
the
macs
i
tested
like
some
of
the
other
posters
i
would
prefer
to
say
on
even
years
or
on
cold
days
for
each
of
these
every
has
so
many
syllables
and
its
not
easily
inserted
unless
the
scope
is
the
focus
of
a
sentence
that
said
if
every
receives
stress
focus
then
1a
and
2a
are
perfectly
acceptable
to
me
as
a
linguistics
student
i
find
this
really
interesting
is
there
any
way
you
could
let
us
know
what
the
reason
for
your
asking
is
at
some
later
date
i
would
be
very
interested
to
find
out
my
reply
as
a
native
english
speaker
who
grew
up
in
england
i
would
not
personally
say
any
of
the
4
sentences
as
they
are
slightly
awkward
but
htat
is
not
to
say
i
find
them
unacceptable
1a
sounds
more
natural
than
1b
and
2b
more
natual
to
me
than
2a
however
i
would
be
more
likely
to
say
1c
elections
are
held
every
other
year
2c
i
wear
a
coat
on
cold
days
which
implies
on
all
cold
days
unfortunately
all
4
sentences
you
provided
sound
awkward
to
me
if
i
had
to
use
the
word
every
and
express
the
same
sentiment
my
first
instinct
gives
me
elections
are
held
every
2
years
on
an
even
year
every
day
that
is
cold
i
wear
a
coat
slightly
closer
to
your
formulation
but
more
awkward
elections
are
held
every
year
in
which
said
year
is
even
i
wear
a
coat
every
day
that
is
cold
at
my
university
no
one
is
antichomsky
per
se
some
of
the
professors
here
do
a
lot
of
work
here
on
corpus
linguistics
and
realize
as
a
result
that
language
is
a
lot
more
formulaic
and
context
dependent
eg
we
use
different
grammatical
conventions
for
speaking
and
writing
than
is
allowed
for
in
chomskys
work
most
of
the
professors
work
in
areas
of
applied
linguistics
and
descriptive
linguistics
from
what
i
have
been
told
about
half
of
the
major
linguistics
departments
in
the
us
focus
on
issues
closer
to
applied
linguistics
or
descriptive
linguistics
and
the
other
half
focus
more
on
theoretical
concerns
in
many
other
countries
i
have
heard
theoretical
linguistics
is
a
lot
less
popular
by
the
way
at
least
two
of
my
favorite
professors
were
followers
of
all
the
latest
trends
in
ug
earlier
in
their
careers
only
to
eventually
feel
that
it
was
not
a
useful
enough
explanatory
framework
several
professors
her
still
use
some
early
transformational
grammar
in
their
explanations
as
well
as
generative
phonology
although
they
will
also
point
out
the
limitations
of
theoretical
linguistics
in
some
perspective
no
one
here
takes
any
of
the
functionalists
approaches
here
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
a
strong
bias
to
doing
quantitative
research
in
my
program

creaky

as
a

mentioned
this
is

that
is

probably
due
to
japanese
people
with
shitty
korean
and
shitty
english
nothing
to
stop
them
from
making
products
with
languages
they
dont
speak
well
including
dictionaries
it
sounds
like
they
just
literally
translated
the
characters
heres
the
link
for
her
as
ive
yet
to
meet
anyone
that
knows
it
redundant
dunno
why
the
downvotes
i
didnt
understand
what
exactly
his
question
was
but
it
is
redundant
in
the
normal
sense
eh
whatever
true
i
have
noticed
quite
a
few
times
when
women
or
girls
themselves
would
address
a
group
made
up
of
entirely
females
also
with
you
guys
you
give
me
hope
to
know
there
is
at
least
one
waiter
out
there
that
doesnt
say
that
i
was
so
surprised
that
i
typed
it
3
times
even
with
kiswahili
to
make
sure
he
hasnt
ive
got
a
few
friends
in
psychologypsychotherapy
and
they
dont
seem
to
think
very
highly
of
freud
til
the
word
anus
comes
from
the
latin
ring
is
that
even
allowed
for
a
linguist
it
shouldnt
be
but
in
some
places
it
is
it
is
actually
a
common
criticism
of
especially
early
chomskyan
work
which
can
be
viewed
in
some
senseswhich
some
might
call
an
unfair
criticismas
pigeonholing
all
other
languages
grammar
into
english
grammar
but
ill
let
the
man
himself
speak
i
have
not
hesitated
to
propose
a
general
principle
of
linguistic
structure
on
the
basis
of
observation
of
a
single
language
the
inference
is
legitimate
on
the
assumption
that
humans
are
not
specifically
adapted
to
learn
one
rather
than
another
human
language
assuming
that
the
genetically
determined
language
faculty
is
a
common
human
possession
we
may
conclude
that
a
principle
of
language
is
universal
if
we
are
led
to
postulate
it
as
a
precondition
for
the
acquisition
of
a
single
language

interesting
i
am
assuming
its
purpose
is
to
split
the
prefix
visually
but
i
could
see
its
use
for
words
like
none
which
i
see
people
trying
use
i
wonder
why
the
umlaut
wasnt
used
in
the
prefix
rstablish
very
intriguing
we
have
the
word
frolic
in
english
why
is
fremont
not
in
the
bay
area
but
mountain
view
is
frankly
im
not
even
sure
what
either
of
them
are
marked
as
hmm
those
two
words
are
pronounced
the
exact
same
to
me
the
example
i
found
was
car
and
bat
which
are
completely
different
so
im
now
confused
synechdoche
or
something
related
also
generification
genericization
my
spellchecker
hates
every
word
of
this
lol
kinda
had
a
suspicion
something
weird
was
going
on
always
seems
like
there
is
something
a
little
off
in
my
voice
when
i
do
the
overseas
travelling
for
30some
hours
thing
just
thought
it
was
my
tongue
readjusting
for
a
different
language
i
actually
found
this
an
extremely
interesting
post
when
it
was
here
originally
my
favorite
part
was
how
she
tried
to
spell
out
our
tonal
i
dont
as
ion
definitely
go
with
the
torrents
some
users
like
to
fan
sub
films
but
its
not
very
common
youtube
is
nice
when
it
comes
to
that
i
actually
have
this
book
laying
around
at
home
collecting
dust
if
youd
like
it
op
im
assuming
with
is
an
objectsituation
while
at
is
a
person
but
if
you
include
angry
with
and
angry
at
it
seems
that
the
two
are
converging
being
used
at
approximately
equal
rates
if
not
in
equal
situations
you
can
always
get
more
specific
later
but
backing
up
to
see
a
bigger
picture
can
be
hard
its
nice
to
get
information
in
context
too
i
wish
that
a
lot
of
my
syntax
learning
had
covered
hpsglfg
a
little
bit
instead
of
just
transformational
generative
grammar
for
instance
because
i
feel
silly
learning
basics
again
phonetics
sounds
tangential
to
me
but
what
do
i
know
at
any
rate
follow
your
heart
it
reminds
me
of
go
and
never
darken
my
towels
again
knowing
a
second
language
is
always
valuable
i
deliberately
took
two
years
off
after
my
undergrad
to
teach
english
abroad
and
learn
another
language
it
seems
to
have
served
me
well
on
my
grad
school
applications
the
others
needed
the
infinitive
afterwards
not
a
gerund
wow
really
thats
pretty
damn
unfortunate
im
not
sure
of
other
places
besides
the
university
of
arizona
that
has
a
computational
linguistics
program
masters
of
science
not
phd
prescriptively
that
is
a
more
colloquial
equivalent
for
both
who
and
which
danish
swedish
and
norwegian
all
have
the
same
combination
of
their
respective
words
for
where
and
for
hvorfor
danish
and
norwegian
and
varfor
swedish
if
i
have
to
give
a
wild
guess
id
say
that
its
possible
that
it
entered
the
english
language
via
old
norsedanish
when
denmark
occupied
the
east
coast
of
england
that
is
according
to
my
professor
how
common
words
like
give
take
and
have
ended
up
in
english
however
as
i
said
im
just
guessing
it
could
just
as
well
be
something
completely
different
here
you
are
but
im
not
sure
from
when
googles
ngram
viewer
doesnt
show
anything
for
either
so
they
must
have
passed
out
of
use
before

as

with

do
you
think
ill
get
much
out

perhaps
they

i
really

im
just

if
you

ill

heh
not

streams
of

can
be
entertaining
to
read
but
eyeinthepyramid
did
claim
that
it
should
be
avoided
i
would
argue
that
the
usage
meaning
perplexed
is
in
my
experience
at
least
the
current
standard
usage
because
ive
never
heard
anyone
actually
use
the
word
the
other
way
perhaps
its
only
being
used
in
this
new
sense
in
certain
regions
in
certain
speech
groups
im
not
sure
ive
heard
it
with
both
meanings
now
that
i
think
about
it
and
i
realize
ive
never
really
noticed
before
the
meaning
never
confused
me
in
any
cases
ive
encountered
it
i
dont
think
otherwise
i
would
have
probably
noted
it
fortunately
the
ministry
of
sound
is
far
from
silent
let
me
just
point
this
article
out
we
made
a
habit
out
of
spelling
words
as
we
pronounced
them
and
simply
dropping
the
idea
of
having
a
rigid
system
of
spelling
then
maybe
we
would
be
more
able
to
accurately
remember
what
people
actually
said
wouldnt
that
in
the
end
be
more
valuable
once
we
get
out
of
this
rigid
mentality
i
wasnt
making
any
definite
claims
about
the
use
of
whilst
i
was
providing
my
own
usage
and
my
own
feelings
based
upon
living
in
the
us
as
an
english
speaker
and
hearing
others
use
the
word
i
also
wasnt
discussing
those
terms
in
strict
any
strict
linguistic
meaning
and
i
believe
i
made
that
quite
clear
when
i
stated
several
times
that
what
i
was
saying
was
my
impressionie
the
feeling
i
get
when
i
hear
the
word
or
what
springs
to
mind
shakespearey
is
not
a
linguistic
term
either
shakespearey
was
not
meant
to
refer
to
solely
the
early
modern
english
spoken
in
the
time
of
shakespeare
i
was
using
it
as
a
term
for
shit
that
sounds
old
do
you
really
think
that
i
thought
that
a
word
is
not
archaic
unless
it
was
used
specifically
in
the
15
or
1600s
or
were
you
just
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
be
condescending
if
you
prefer
to
have
a
discussion
with
sticks
shoved
up
both
our
asses
then
the
proper
linguistic
term
is
ideolect
not
ideodialect
there
was
already
some
initial
stuff
done
on
the
pirah
dont
actually
have
any
words
for
numbers
and
this
affects
how
they
deal
with
mathematical
concepts
as
simple
as
counting
yeah
i
pretty
much
tldred
it
i
suppose
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
a
language
organ
but
i
have
no
opinions
on
the
holistic
nature
of
such
a
thing
theres
plenty
of
evidence
for
strictly
linguistic
universals
or
at
least
we
havent
found
other
aspects
of
cognition
which
have
the
same
constraints
maybe
we
will
but
whether
or
not
that
requires
a
language
organ
in
a
proper
sense
i
dont
know
im
not
sure
it
matters
either
but
its
hardly
like
the
absence
of
a
feature
is
just
magically
tucked
away
into
ug
and
how
do
you
falsify
it
well
you
look
for
a
language
with
such
a
feature
or
you
try
to
teach
the
feature
to
children
its
pretty
easy
really
if
something
is
supposed
to
be
strictly
impossible
due
to
ug
and
some
people
have
it
or
you
can
teach
them
it
then
its
not
strictly
impossible
due
to
ug
its
classic
falsificationism
as
for
the
minimalist
program
i
agree
that
the
philosophical
motivations
for
the
mp
are
rubbish
but
the
technical
aspects
are
interesting
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
the
norman
invasion
of
england
in
1066
for
a
long
time
after
that
french
was
the
language
of
the
upper
class
anglosaxon
the
language
of
the
lower
class
and
latin
the
language
of
the
privileged
religious
sphere
there
is
still
a
bias
today
for
french
words
sounding
highclass
sophisticated
and
even
snobby
middle
english
borrowed
words
from
both
latin
and
french
at
this
time
and
this
is
also
why
there
are
many
sets
of
3
words
in
english
that
mean
the
same
thing
but
have
slightly
different
stylistic
usages
like
kingly
from
anglosaxon
royal
from
french
and
regal
from
latin
no
it
is
for
undergraduates
graduate
students
and
practicing
linguists
i
encourage
anyone
in
particular
undergraduates
and
graduate
students
who
is
interested
in
furthering
hisher
knowledge
on
language
systems
to
attend
the
summer
institute
in
order
to
take
courses
not
typically
offered
at
hisher
university
self
promotion
then
i
encourage
anyone
interested
in
learning
about
language
documentation
and
language
revitalisation
to
attend
infieldcolang
in
the
summer
of
2012
at
the
university
of
kansas
lawrence
i
and
another
colleague
will
be
hosting
the
6week
programme
you
will
get
the
opportunity
to
learn
the
latest
techniques
in
language
documentation
and
practice
your
skills
by
working
with
real
language
collaborators

and
your

is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
backasswards
maybe
only
heard
here
in
oklahoma
i
learned
a
language
similar
to
bontoc
when
i
was
in
the
peace
corps
the
language
is
called
kankanaey
or
igorot
what
a
crazy
language
everything
is
prefixes
suffixes
and
infixes
you
could
take
a
noun
and
add
men
or
sometimes
um
to
the
word
to
make
it
a
verb
example
udan
rain
umudan
to
rain
my
favorite
part
of
the
language
was
syllable
repetition
example
umudan
to
rain
umududan
its
raining
umudududududan
its
raining
and
raining
and
raining
like
crazy
mengulong

upvoted
for
two
reasons
1
so
people
will
stop
saying
language

declining
per
the
top
comments
and
2
so
people
will
start
using
the
phrase
guerilla

a
morph

sa
lots
and
lots
of
influence
from
local

and

theres
also
an
issue
with
which
class
level
of
the
population
originally
spoke
the
language
and
english
in
the
us
was
always
more
common
per

than
dutch
in
southafrica
yes
but
then
theres
that
thing
i
forget
the
name
of
the
phenomena
now
but
i
know
i
mean
its
on
the
tip
of

most
definitely

thank
you
this
is

i
have
shared
it
with
my
linguistics
class
you
know
i
heard
that
thats
actually
not
true
when
you
break
down
a
lot
the
nouns
in
indoeuropean
languages
im
not
sure
where
i
read
that
and
im
too
unmotivated
to
double
check
but
i
thought
id
throw
that
out
there
forget
about
german
in
dutch
the
diminutive
suffix
tjeje
is
as
prevalent
as
in
brazilian
portuguese
biertje
anyone
as
many
others
have
mentioned
its
easier
to
you
because
your
body
learned
to
form
these
sounds
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
life
the
very
relaxed
feeling
youre
talking
about
is
called
a
dipthong
and
its
very
difficult
for
people
whose
native
language
doesnt
have
such
sounds
it
drives
my
kiddies
over
here
absolutely
bonkers
we
have
words
like
tire
which
are
one
syllable
and
very
easy
for
us
to
pronounce
they
turn
the
same
exact
word
into
three
syllables
and
spell
it
sounds
like
tah
ee
uh
when
they
see
a
simple
one
syllable
english
word
which
is
a
bitch
to
read
anyway
because
of
our
spelling
they
have
to
practice
a
ton
before
they
can
say
the
word
fast
enough
to
be
understood
im
currently
attempting
to
learn
french
this
would
be
an
amazing
idea
i
currently
live
in
montreal
but
its
impossible
to
practice
french
because
everybody
assumes
you
speak
english
i
have
a
little
background
in

now
wouldnt
that

of

some
is
a

in
that
its
a

are

like
a

a

i
never
thought
that
i
would
see
a
joke
explained
in
six
paragraphs
before
in
french
its
much
like
english
the
verb
is
sent
back
to
the
end
of
the
sentence
i
dont
think
asking
for
grammaticality
judgments
is
really
akin
to
asking
for
pointblank
help
on
an
assignment
its
not
like
she
is
straightup
asking
is
this
a
raising
or
a
control
verb
im
writing
my
thesis
on
syntax
and
i
have
to
outsource
my
grammaticality
judgments
to
my
unbiased
friends
quite
often
sometimes
it
just
gets
to
a
point
where
everything
sounds
grammatical
to
the
op
it
sounds
ungrammatical
to
me
it
is
however
somewhat
better
than
tabs
proved
to
be
kept
on
john
which
is
not
acceptable
at
all
complexity
and
brevity
lay
in
tension
at
all
times
so
as
a
language
acquires
more
complicated
forms
for
tense
for
example
it
may
drop
excess
case
indications
or
make
word
order
more
substantive
people
need
to
be
able
to
say
what
they
want
to
say
both
clearly
and
concisely
so
the
counterbalancing
of
these
two
leaves
most
languages
roughly
where
they
have
always
been
no
real
net
effect
in
terms
of
phonoaesthetics
cellar
door
is
high
on
my
list
another
good
one
is
thalassocrat
they
usually
stick
to
the
tones
a
lot
of
set
poem
structures
dictate
not
only
syllables
but
also
tone
patterns
tang
and
song
poetry
had
these
in
fact
song
poetry
known
as
ci
is
good
evidence
that
ancient
chinese
songs
did
pay
attention
to
tones
song
ci
are
poems
set
to
songs
that
have
been
long
forgotten
but
they
retain
tonal
and
syllable
patterns
this
i
learnt
ubuntu
has
ftfy
seriously
though
there
are
many
past
tenses
and
past
participles
with
ted
variants
in
british
english
other
examples
are
dreameddreamt
leanedleant
and
leapedleapt
in
each
case
either
form
is
acceptable
and
neither
is
preferred
over
the
other
the
vowel
is
ee
as
in
meet
in
the
forms
ending
in
ed
and
e
as

met
in
the

la

onda
if
im
not
mistaken
but
not
very
common
in
colloquial
french
in
my
meagre
experience
of
course
you
do
remember
that
there
are
4
parts
and
youll
only
have
trouble
with
the
speaking
one
and
even
then
if
you
take
formal
classes
it
might
not
be
as
bad
as
you
think
im
a
rather
shy
person
myself
unless
there
is
a
very
well
defined
purpose
for
speaking
and
i
find
that
actual
classes
tend
to
provide
that
sla
in
general
is
much
more
purpose
driven
until
you
get
relatively
high
up
you
should
also
take
a
quick
look
at
this
entry
about
affective
filter
thats
true
about
idear
tho
there
you
have
vowel
hiatus
which
might
be
at
issue
syllable

be

english
id
say
get
recordings
so
we
can
measure
it
objectively
language
isnt
totally
free
from
standards
for
instance
any
given
native
speaker
of
any
given
language
can
issue
an
intuitive
sort
of
grammaticality
judgment
that
deals
with
the
degree
to
which
a
certain
sentence
rubs
them
the
wrong
way
or
makes
no
sense
at
all
i
be
going
to
school
sounds
off
to
me
in
my
dialect
although
i
can
understand
what
it
means
and
i
am
totally
aware
that
speakers
of
other
dialects
use
constructions
like
this
on
a
regular
basis
be
me
school
to
go
is
right
out
though
i
cant
think
of
an
english
dialect
that
would
say
something
like
this
and
it
takes
me
a
second
to
even
figure
out
what
it
might
mean
semantically
i
know
intrusive
r
is
a
pronunciation
thing
more
than
a
syntaxsemantics
issue
but
i
hope
that
still
answers
your
question
in
general
if
90
of
a
population
agrees
that
something
is
grammatical
it
is
in
a
way
legitimized
because
it
means
that
90
of
that
population
understands
and
uses
it
the
other
10
can
try
to
tell
them
they
shouldnt
but
they
wont
meet
with
much
success
ever
met
a
prescriptivist
who
was
a
stickler
about
whowhom
best
of
luck
to
them
but
english
is
kind
of
moving
on
im
not
the
best
person
to
ask
about
the
philosophy
of
it
all
but
i
do
think
that
in
this
context
language
is
different
from
other
behaviors
without
going
into
your
personal
views
on
the
origin
of
morals
or
cultural
relativism
or
anything
it
wouldnt
cause
you
or
anyone
else
any
physical
harm
if
i
said
i
be
going
to
school
if
youre
a
prescriptivist
it
might
be
against
your
rules
and
it
might
even
annoy
you
when
you
hear
it
spoken
but
its
not
morally
wrong
the
same
way
rape
or
murder
would
be
wrong
to
the
average
member
of
most
human
societies
i
really
dont
think
theres
any
evidence
that
people
with
very
low
mental
function
are
currently
constituting
a
higher
percentage
of
the
population
than
they
ever
have
you
are
however
hitting
on
a
very
common
theme
among
prescriptivists
that
is
the
quality
of
language
is
getting
progressively
worse
or
corrupted
the
reason
that
so
many
people
believe
this
is
they
have
such
a
hard
time
understanding
this
fact
theres
nothing
intrinsic
to
a
natural
language
that
makes
it
worse
or
better
in
any
way
understand
that
this
isnt
a
moral
judgment
its
simply
a
fact
there
are
reasons
we
pass
moral
judgments
on
people
who
speak
in
certain
manners
but
none
of
these
reasons
have
anything
to
do
with
the
phonemes
or
syntax
of
such
people
its
a
subtle
point
but
its
crucial
in
understanding
descriptive
linguistics
also
know
that
people
have
been
decrying
the
death
of
language
for
a
long
long
time
a
few
millennia
ago
roman
scholars
scoffed
at
the
ignorance
of
the
barbarians
in
gallia
and
iberia
who
spoke
in
butchered
latin
today
we
call
those
barbaric
tongues
french
and
spanish
no
what
hes
hearing
is
quite
real
intrusiver
is
common
in
britain
also
im
pretty
sure
youre
confusing
the
general
american
with
the
british
is
used
in
every
american
dialect
i
know
of
so
i
doubt
if
hes
an
american
english
speaker
that
his
dialect
is
missing
that
phoneme
ive
taken
a
fair
share
of
linguistics
courses
i
understand
that
language
changes
and
that
people
can
communicate
with
rules
which
differ
from
those
lauded
by
grammarians
i
also
understand
that
many
types
of
cloth
can
and
will
cover
my
body
and
keep
me
warm
that
does
not
mean
i
wear
rags
to
the
office
or
would
hesitate
to
suggest
my
colleagues
wear
shoes
my
understanding
of
natural
language
is
not
counter
to
my
passion
for
correctness
in
speech
and
writing
the
problem
here
is
that
reddit
is
not
a
formal
setting
i
generally
dont
capitalize
anything
which
is
pretty
much
a
dead
on
indication
of
my
informal
register
its
the
best
i
can
do
in
writing
so
when
these
arguments
come
up
on
reddit
they
are
basically
saying
you
should
use
your
formal
register
all
the
time
its
the
right
way
of
things
which
is
not
true
it
would
be
easy
to
point
out
a
time
where
a
formal
register
is
not
good
in
any
case
its
often
not
what
they
are
saying
its
the
reason
they
tell
you
to
be
correct
if
someone
just
says
its
youre
by
the
way
its
not
a
big
deal
but
thats
often
not
the
way
they
do
it
you
can
argue
with
their
reasoning
but
theyll
have
none
of
it
because
they
often
think
youre
arguing
with
what
theyre
saying
id
rather
someone
misunderstand
a
spelling
convention
than
misunderstand
a
basic
idea
in
linguistics
and
now
im
just
ranting
i
think
if
both
are
used
and
understood
why
is
one
more
correct
but
are
they
if
one
is
a
clear
corruption
of
the
other
sounds
more
or
less
the
same
spoken
but
makes
no
sense
when
written
one
is
correct
because
there
is
a
historical
lineage
and
etymology
that
leads
to
it
or
its
correct
because
thats
the
rule
theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
rules
rules
and
their
enforcement
are
a
way
of
restricting
linguistic
change
theres
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
that
either
do
you
deny
that
affecteffect
should
be
corrected
are
you
a
complete
descriptivist
any
usage
is
okay
regardless
of
whether
it
is
incidental
or
essential
it
is
our
current
reality
i
liken
your
views
on
grammar
correction
as
class
discrimination
to
saying
that
basing
college
admittance
on
grades
or
test
scores
is
racist
because
it
results
in
certain
groups
being
underrepresented
i
would
disagree
that
that
is
a
racist
practice
despite
the
fact
that
it
de
facto
differentiates
between
races
similarly
i
deny
that
correcting
grammar
is
inherently
classreinforcing
even
though
it
turns
out
to
be
so
in
many
cases
thus
i
object
to
your
implication
that
correcting
grammarusage
is
nothing
but
a
reinforcement
of
class
structure
braking
process
i
mean
that
by
correcting
usage
one
may
slow
or
redirect
the
linguistic
change
this
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
process
as
the
expanded
usage
the
bad
thing
about
spanglish
is
that
it
combines
and
adds
up
the
shitty
quality
of
spanish
with
the
shitty
quality
of
english
however
english
is
the
only
current
language
to
save
germanic
languages
and
spanish
is
the
only
current
language
to
save
italic
languages
note
the
degree
of
parallelism
between
english
and
spanish
is
remarkable
so
remarkable
that
for
many
spanish
people
it
is
much
easier
to
learn
english
than
to
learn
french
britishenglish
in
psycholinguistics
we
often
call
these
three
classes
words
legal
pseudowords
and
illegal
pseudowords
and
of
course
theres
a
fourth
class
that
we
just
call
consonant
strings
which
comprises
words
like
btfpr
that
are
impossible
in
pretty
much
any
language
i
have
absolutely
no
comment
to
make
about
your
tatt
but
i
just
want
to
go
stark
raving
bonkers
about
how
much
i
hate
this
particular
language
test
for
reasons
like
timofeypnin
mentions
and
others
its
like
the
smug
kid
who
sits
at
the
front
of
the
class
and
who
thinks
she
knows
all
the
answers
but
theyre
often
if
not
usually
wrong
and
then
they
blame
the
teacher
for
not
understanding
them
oh
and
sic
in
reference
to
definiteindefinite
articles
hmm
which
parts
which
languages
i
see
i
see
youre
right
i
suppose
that
a
language
imposed
from
the
top
down
would
have
to
be
a
really
strong
prestige
language
thered
have
to
be
something
like
you
will
learn
to
speak
this
or
you
will
die
also
its
impossible
to
survive
without
this
language
because
i
said
so
i
believe
you
are
thinking
of
maps
of
war
for
example
the
imperial
history
of
the
middle
east
edit
changed

video
mi
a
dialect
of
the
miyako
language
of
japan
violates
the
implicational
universal
that
if
a
language
has
syllabic
fricatives
it
will
also
have
syllabic
liquids
but
it
depends
on
the
analysis
either
is
a
liquidand
it
breaks
the
rules

it

sorry
couldnt
resist
by
the
question
you
quoted
i
meant
to
highlight
the
variation
over
time
and
to
suggest
that
if
it
is
in
fact
the
contemporary
version
we
are
discussing
when
we
say
english
then
were
leaving
out
certain
origin
criteria
which
would
lessen
even
further
any
english
claims
on
the
language
but
to
your
point
about
about
native
versus
secondlanguage
learners
can
you
explain
why
that
might
be
important
i
mean
beyond
describing
the
current
focus
of
esl
teachers
i
realize
my
criteria
are
completely
made
up
but
i
think
they
are
at
least
somewhat
reasonable
and
to
my
mind
whether
it
is
a
populations
first
or
second
language
is
not
as
important
as
the
raw
number
of
english
speakers
in
a
population
i
just
found
this
thread
because
i
was
searching
google
to
find
out
the
exact
same
thing
suppose
i
write
a
letter
from
me
sic
to
you
really
sic
thats
my
answer
and
im
sticking
with
it
wow
ive
just
realized
the
relation
between
catalan
manteniment
maintenance
and
french
maintenant
manteniment
and
maintenance
come
from
latin
manutenre
man
hand
tenere
holding
this
is
largely
assumption
so
feel
free
to
correct
me
but
i
liked
realising
that
awful
and
awesome
are
much
more
similar
than
their
meanings
would
make
you
think
i
wonder
if
it
might
be
useful
for
style
contemporary
english
draws
on
early
modern
english
as
a
register
periodically
in
fantasy
literature
authors
use
certain
constructs
and
vocabulary
that
feel
right
in
context
yet
would
be
borderline
archaic
in
any
other
modern
context
that
flexibility
of
style
is
a
strength
and
languages
without
a
long
written
history
would
presumably
be
lacking
it
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
retains
a
certain
magic
to
it
precisely
because
of
the
archaisms
thou
shalt
not
kill
vs
you
shall
not
kill
in
spanish
class
i
learned
basic
structure
and
conjugation
but
mostly
focused
on
practical
application
for
example
i
was
taught
to
say
me
llamo
tinari
when
introducing
myself
not
much
emphasis
was
placed
on
understanding
constructions
in
latin
ive
been
taught
that
its
imperative
to
understand
in
order
to
do
yes
i
believe
it
is
probably
just
as
easyeasier
and
certainly
more
practical
to
learn
a
modern
romance
language
after
learning
spanish
instead
of
latin
no
i
think
that
learning
latin
is
much
more
beneficial
to
ones
understanding
of
english
than
another
language
may
be
latin
to
me
is
very
mathematical
in
that
one
finds
the
proper
construction
equation
and
then
plugs
in
the
necessary
articles
example
between
you
and
me
vs
between
you
and
i
in
spanish
the
correct
way
to
say
this
is
entre
t
y
yo
even
though
yo
is
the
subject
form
equivalent
to
the
english
i
although
im
not
sure
why
incorrect
a
latin
student
would
know
that
between
is
a
preposition
inter
which
takes
the
accusative
case
the
accusative
case
of
the
first
person
singular
in
english
is
me
as
in
between
you
and
me
correct
edit
holy
crap
i
didnt
mean
to
post
an
entire
essay
in
response
to
something
you
said
half
a
month
ago
this
so
bad
had
to
learn
this
different
version
of
norwegian
nynorsk
im
bokmaal
and
those
differences
but
still
not
so
different
differences
can
really
fk
your
mind
up
your
example
with
the
dutch
was
that
exact
feeling
well
not
phonology
but
i
have
a
skullp
syntactic
phrase
in
one
of
my
facebook
albums
with
an
actual
skull
character
i
found
in
a
latex
package
theres
also
the
dinner
theory
with
dessert
phrase
and
meal
phrase
that
i
pioneered
on
a
napkin
at
a
dinner
im
still
working
out
the
structure
for
that
this
actually
is
the
phenomenon
that
made
me
aware
that
i
too
had
a
dialect
and
wasnt
just
some
perfect
dialectless
midwest
speaker
i
thought
the
midwest
had
no
dialect
and
was
just
correct
sae
was
more
of
a
novice
at
this
point
i
was
in
germany
and
people
were
eager
to
hear
my
american
english
and
especially
wanted
children
to
hear
me
speak
and
i
was
really
apprehensive
because
it
made
me
listen
to
myself
more
closely
and
wonder
what
the
hell
this
sloppy
shit
coming
out
of
my
mouth
was
feel
better
now
though
bear
in
mind
calculus
wont
help
you
directly
its
pretty
much
only
useful
for
having
a
better
understanding
of
stats
as
to
a
minor
being
enough
possibly
but
the
thing
is
cl
is
one
of
the
fields
where
the
difference
between
being
a
good
programmer
and
a
great
programmer
is
really
important
at
the
very
least
you
need
to
do
the
advanced
algorithms
course
and
do
well
in
it
btw
why
not
do
a
major
in
cs
and
a
minor
in
ling
it
depends
on
which
hypothesis
of
vowel
qualities
in
old
japanese
you
follow
all
the
examples
i
gave
are
restricted
to
two
old
japanese
texts
the
kojiki
composed
in
600
and
700s
ce
and
the
manysh
composed
in
the
700s
ce
both
are
in
the
western
dialect
of
old
japanese
which
the
majority
of
remaining
texts
are
written
in
in
the
analysis
i
follow
after
marc
miyakes
1999
analysis
there
are
seven
vowels
and
one
diphthong
there
are
many
other
systems
including
ones
done
mainly
by
altaicists
that
purport
vowel
harmony
just
5
vowels
6
vowels
and
many
others
with
none
being
held
as
consensus
the
system
is
as
follows

even
during

this

japanese
the
western
dialects
in
contrast
to
central
or
eastern
dialects
were
the
most
conservative
in
regards
to
this
reduction
the
collapse
was
basically
complete
by
middle
japanese
which
has
almost
the
same
vowel
system
as
modern
kansai
dialects
merging

what

for

of

ive
never
heard
you
speak
kaiyoht
for
me
i
believe
in
russian
theres
a
distinction
too
the
difference
is
in
english
we
can
specify
shades
of
blue
but
the
fact
remains
that
we
still
think
of
them
as
shades
of
the
same
colour
by
default
think
about
how
we
differentiate
pink
and
red
there
are
cultures
and
languages
who
dont
think
of
them
any
differently
than
light
red
and
red
we
know
pink
is
just
a
lighter
shade
of
red
but
we
still
call
it
a
different
colour
and
think
of
it
as
such
also
morse
code
can
be
used
to
communicate
other
languages
besides
english
you
have
to
make
some
adaptations
but
anything
written
in
a
version
of
the
latin
alphabet
can
be
easily
transcribed
in
morse
code
this
could
probably
be
have
been
extended
to
other
writing
systems
but
i
dont
know
of
it
are
they
really
sure
that

hello
friends
how
about
some
data
for
myself
us
english
i
would
say
get
in
the
van
but
it
appears
that
people
may
say
on
as
well
particularly
when
it
involves
a
group
transport
it
seems
as
though
the
physical
specifications
of
the
vehicle
may
matter
less
than
the
way
in
which
the
vehicle
is
used
here
are
a
couple
examples
i
found
with
a
google
search
both
cases
involve
the
multiseat
passenger
van
not
a
busstyle
shuttle
members
frequently
meet
in
one
or
two
common
locations
like
a
park
and
ride
to
get
on
the
van
at
the
beginning
of
the
days
trip
ada
county
highway
district
commuteride
why
rush
or
choose
to
be
told
to
get
on
the
van
just
because
the
tour
company
had
to
some
guys
blog
about
touring
lost
locations
in
hawaii
interesting
in
this
case
he
also
writes
sitting
in
the
van
so
it
does
appear
to
have
to
do
with
the
act
of
boarding
which
has
already
been
established
only
two
examples
but
its
a
decent
representation
since
one
is
a
more
officialformal
communication
and
the
other
is
more
informal
speech
ultimately
both
of
you
should
cool
it
a
little
get
on
the
van
still
sounds
wrong
to
me
but
it
appears
that
at
least
a
few
people
would
say
that
surprising
to
me

here
danish
grammar
is
fairly
simple
assuming
that
you
come
from
another

the

will
be
awfull
to
learn

will
learning
how

actually
said
send
me
a

with
your
email
and
ill
send
you
a
beginner
grammar
of
danish
no
never
fuck
as
a
washingtonian
i
am
befuddled
by
your
posts
i
dont
think
ive
heard
other
pnwers
use
the
in
that
manner
im
sure
there
are
plenty
of
people
with
that
trait
around
but
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
typical
of
the
pnw
accent
he
married
into
the
windsor
house
and
thus
is
a
prince
consort
rather
than
a
king
while
his
wife
is
queen
same
reason
prince
albert
wasnt
a
king
id
respond
but
im
just
sort
of
sort
of
keyboard
blocked
im
uh
kind
of
thumb
tied
thumbs
up
and
tied
if
you
know
what
i
mean
here
in
front
of
the
monitor
and
seeing
my
words
out
there
and
all
no
youre
absolutely
right
that
this
is
not
unique
to
a
comparison
between
english
and
japanese
but
it
is
a
feature
that
i
noticed
to
be
challenging
in
learning
japanese
more
so
than
it
is
for
any
of
the
other
languages
ive
learned
at
least
some
grammar
of
spanish
german
i
didnt
mean
to
give
the
impression
that
most
languages
phrase
things
in
the
same
ways
english
does
but
just
that
its
different
enough
in
japanese
to
be
noted
as
something
that
makes
japanese
particularly
challenging
for
english
speakers
you
know
obviously
its
not
a
huge
difference
from
other
langauge
learning
processes
i
just
was
trying
to
think
of
things
i
had
particular
trouble
with
while
taking
japanese
101
in
order
to
broaden
my
examples
for
why
japanese
isnt
just
a
piece
of
cake
language
to
learn
for
english
speakers
wouldnt
it
be
mia
profesora
where
we
got
the
agreements
i
have
no
idea
orthographic
means
one
letter
always
corresponds
to
one
and
only
one
sound
english
and
french
are
notoriously
nonorthographic
a
corpus
is
a
big
collection
of
samples
of
language
for
example
here
is
a
a
100
million
word
collection
of
samples
of
written
and
spoken
language
from
a
wide
range
of
sources
designed
to
represent
a
wide
crosssection
of
current
british
english
both
spoken
and
written
im
sure
that
theres
an
equivalent
in
other
countries
all
these
corpuses
together
make
the
corpora
which
is
the
latin
plural
p
you
should
come
its
not
a
bad
place
im
hoping
all
yall
can
start
an
independent
thread
bashing
every
bit
of
the
site
that
looks
like
its
from
two
decades
ago
ill
print
it
out
and
leave
it
under
the
higherups
doors
yeah
i
knew
you
had
to
have
a
masters
just
didnt
know
in
what
specifically
haha
i
dont
think
mine
has
a
speech
and
hearing
science
major
unfortunately
see
above
i
guess
slavic
morphology
makes
an
animateinanimate
distinction
some
do
indeed
but
it
exists
within
gender
distinctions
so
the
gender
is
still
just
as
relevant
is
any
language
without
an
animate
distinction
nouns
are
still
basically
mfn
before
anything
else
and
the
distinction
only
exists
within
certain
genders
or
cases
as
do
certain
danish
dialects
i
know
danish
pretty
well
and
while
ive
heard
people
who
dont
use
the
feminine
gender
with
nouns
the
commonneuter
distinction
is
not
based
on
animacy
plenty
of
inanimate
nouns
take
the
common
mf
gender
so
example
maybe
ive
never
heard
that
dialect
in
pie
the
female
gender
wasnt
based
on
the
sound
but
rather
the
presence
of
the
h2
suffix
i
didnt
say
pie
i
said
latin
sanskrit
and
ancient
greek
as
i
understand
comparative
linguistics
while
keeping
in
mind
that
my
studiesprofession
is
in
a
different
subfield
if
you
find
a
something
that
all
descendant
languages
have
in
common
that
it
is
probably
true
that
their
parent
language
had
that
feature
as
well
excuse
me
if
i
dont
speak
hittite
and
anatolian
too
well
sihlers
new
comparative
grammar
i
will
try
to
find
this
as

and
hopefully
ill
have

a
few
hundred
yes
arika
okrents
delightful
in
the

has
a

chapter
on

its
a
good

in

if
you
are
interested
in
constructed
languages
i
dont
know
if
id
be
able
to
make
it
but
here
are
some
cool
places
ive
found
that
might
be
of
interest
the
farmers
market
is
from
48pm
on
wednesdays
it
is
on
13th
street
between
arapahoe
and
canyon
next
to
the
downtown
central
park
if
its
nice
out
its
a
nice
place
to
go
and
sit
and
eatpeople
watch
theyve
got
lots
of
food
vendors
and
is
just
a
block
away
from
the
pearl
st
mall
its
a
good
way
to
get
a
feel
of
what
boulder
is
about
mountain
sun
brewery
on
pearl
street
is
not
bad
for
hanging
out
theyre
a
local
brewery
and
my
boyfriend
and
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
there
are
easy
to
get
tofrom
campus
sure
it
can
firstbeatingbloodyingbruising
it
can
have
the
same
meaning
if
people
use
it
in
that
sense
that
german
word
itself
doesnt
mention
police
or
beating
all
the
meaning
comes
from
context
well
the
chinese
government
also
does
a
fair
job
at
trying
to
convince
the
world
and
themselves
that
they
are
a
homogenous
society
at
least
from
my
limited
experience
do
you
mean
pronouncing
that
nasal
as
an
interdental
absolutely
technically
theres
no
interdental
diacritic
in
the
ipa
so
when
ive
seen
one
transcribed
its
always
using
the
dental
diacritic
this
causes
problems
sometimes
because
it
then
cannot
be
distinguished
from
an
actual
dental
nasal
where
the
tongue
meets
the
back
of
the
teeth
such
as
if
a
phonemic
alveolar
nasal
were
followed
by
a
dental
t
of
course
the
number
of
times
you
would
need
to
distinguish
between
those
two
is
quite
small
no
language
as
far
as
i
know
uses
a
phonemic
interdental
nasal
so
i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
additionally
nasals
followed
by
stop
consonants
are
almost
always
homorganic
anyway
not
always
but
pretty
darn
close
edit
interesting
trivia
theres
also
not
an
ipa
symbol
for
a
postalveolar
nasal
ive
always
seen
it
transcribed
as
n
with
a
retracted
diacritic
under
it
articulated
in
the
same
neighborhood
but
the
manner
of
articulation
is
completely
different
between
the
three
unless
ive
had
some
serious
miseducation
l
has
alveolar
contact
even
though
its
considered
an
approximant
due
to
being
a
lateral
in
other
words
the
fact
that
its
lateral
means
that
there
is
central
contact
same
as
t
wikipedia
great
unreliable
bastion
of
knowledge
that
it
is
appears
to
agree
emphasis
added
most
commonly
in
lateral
consonants
the
tip
of
the
tongue
makes
contact
with
the
upper
teeth
see
dental
consonant
or
the
upper
gum
the
alveolar
ridge
just
behind
the
teeth
see
alveolar
consonant
the
most
common
laterals
are
approximants
and
belong
to
the
class
of
liquids
thats
why
this
phonological
effect
doesnt
happen
with
theres
no
contact
whatsoever
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
arbitrary
it
was
decided
at
one
point
and
its
been
kept
roughly
consistent
for
a
long
time
as
far
as
i
know
you
might
want
to
seek
out
a
historical
linguist
for
a
good
satisfying
answer
and
if
you
do
please
share
the
results
they
call
them
bum
bags
in
the
uk
the
word
fanny
refers
to
a
slightly
different
part
of
the
human
anatomy
over
there
so
whats
the
term
for
the
tv
series
eg
buffy
is
the
series
but
buffy
season
1
is
the
season
im
going
to
have
to
start
reading
this
blog
i
like
this
guy
my
arent
we
a
tad
violent
but
first
20
seasons
of
doctor
who
were
seasons
isnt
it
maybe
the
use
has
changed
during
the
last
20
years
ifn
he
does
huck
prolly
larned
it
from
tom
does
anyone
know
anyone
whos
ever
used
the
phrase
holy
hannah
actually
there
arent
many
established
tests
of
vocabulary
size
which
are
valid
theres
some
mention
of
this
in
the
faq
which
may
interest
you
basically
almost
all
tests
of
vocabulary
size
suffer
from
one
of
the
methodological
flaws
identified
by
thorndike
in
the
early
1920s
im
not
sure
i
would
classify
subjects
as
stronger
or
weaker
but
rather
trying
to
measure
reality
so
that
we
can
use
that
to
explain
differences
in
other
phenomena
such
as
reading
we
are
creating
other
tests
of
word
knowledge
such
as
knowledge
of
affixes
collocations
register
etc
which
will
eventually
be
correlated
with
size
scores
to
create
a
more
comprehensive
test
of
vocabulary
knowledge
and
its
evolution
over
time
in
both
native
and
nonnative
speakers
we
also
record
how
long
it
takes
to
answer
each
question
and
it
looks
like
there
is
a
good
correlation
between
size
and
speed
which
likely
indicates
a
fluency
aspect
to
word
knowledge
this

seems

did

i

so
anyway
i
dont

chinese
mushu
wrap
rap
is
the

of
the

i
am
only
slightly
capable
of
speaking
in
french
basic
french
throughout
juniorhigh
school
but
even
so
i
find
my
ahs
are
pronounced
differently
in
french
than
they
are
english
i
suppose
you
just
adopt
the
native
characteristics
freereflections
talking
about
a
couple
of
mergers
that
americans
and
specifically
southern
americans
make
the
feelfill
merger
and
the
failfell
merger
i
think
its
chomsky
who
demonstrated
this
with
his
work
in
contextfree
grammars
and
s
expressions
back
in
the
50s
and
60s
basically
because
of
recursion
human
languages
are
all
equally
expressive
i
still
struggle
to
find
some
words
to
complete
my
thoughts
i
imagine
my
sentence
in
french
then
translate
each
word
but
ive
been
improving
my
skills
since
a
year
thanks
to
internet
forums
my
sign
language
professor
attended
a
few
international
signing
conventions
or
something
of
the
sort
he
said
that
while
almost
all
of
it
was
unintelligible
for
the
obvious
reasons
given
by
meika
there
were
a
lot
of
signs
and
general
ideas
that
could
be
gotten
across
he
actually
had
an
indepth
though
somewhat
stuttering
discussion
about
syntax
and
grammatical
structure
with
someone
from
england
for
instance
stemming
from
a
distinction
over
the
sign
for
milk
anyway
signed
languages
tend
to
be
a
level
of
abstraction
closer
to
meaning
ie
a
step
away
from
the
arbitrariness
which
is
common
of
all
spoken
natural
languages
and
a
little
bit
less
natural
than
other
natural
languages
this
gives
speakers
a
better
chance
at
mutual
intelligibility
and
knowing
one
form
of
sign
language
its
relatively
much
more
simple
to
pick
up
another
than
it
would
be
for
say
an
english
speaker
to
get
dutch
or
even
frisian
i
think
he
has
claimed
something
along
the
lines
of
it
being
as
the
result
of
selection
for
general
cognitive
abilities
but
i
cant
remember
where
i
saw
this
this
is
my
vote
too
latin
alphabet
large
refugee
community
in
the
us
part
of
a
small
language
family
i
hope
this
doesnt
sound
flippant
but
in
those
cases
the
phenomena
are
titled
indeed
there
are
two
of
them
at
play
borrowing
and
generalization
borrowing
happens
during
periods
of
interlanguage
exposure
and
certain
words
are
coopted
taken
from
one
side
or
the
other
by
either
side
to
address
culturalenvironmentalinterpersonal
items
that
is
not
accounted
for
in
their
native
language
this
is
then
combined
with
generalization
this
term
is
the
opposite
of
narrowing
a
word
becomes
much
less
specific
over
prolonged
use
within
the
society
this
has
happened
much
more
often
now
that
we
are
constantly
exposed
to
advertising
and
have
access
to
much
more
information
nonculturally
related
generalizations
would
be
kleenex
for
tissues
and
coke
for
soda
or
pop
in
the
south
e
oops
i
misread
the
question
blake161
is
correct
the
term
sombrero
does
indeed
refer
to
all
hats
in
spanish
but
english
only
uses
it
to
refer
to
a
specific
type
of
hat
if
youre
going
to
extend
may
argument
to
furniture
and
math
which
on
second
thought
is
definitely
correct
you
may
as
well
extend
it
to
all
mass
nouns
at
which
point
your
arguing
that
every
mass
noun
has
a
sister
noun
meaning
types
of
thing
and
possibly
another
word
meaning
arbitrary
quantity
of
thing
after
a
quick
look
at
wikipedia
it
seems
that
many
whatever
that
means
people
have
noted
that
uncountable
nouns
can
be
counted
and
count
nouns
can
be
used
in
a
mass
sense
at
least
in
english
and
at
least
one
linguist
has
suggested
that
there
isnt
a
lexical
distinction
at
all
while
the
ideas
in
my
initial
post
were
half
baked
at
best
i
dont
think
im

indoeuropean
and
turkic
languages
are
generally
written
left
to
right
semitic
languages
such
as
arabic
are
written
right
to
left
it
just
takes
one
powerful
empire
to
popularize
a
writing
system
across
countires
and
eventually
form
all
the
constituent
derived
languages
that
we
see
today
also
sit
in
toronto
here
seems
pretty
far
reaching
i
would
say
a
mix
of
media
communication
between
others
in
indian
country
and
a
shared
sense
of
native
identity
that
people
are
willing
to
adopt
the
conceived
accent
as
a
nativeauthenticator
of
sorts
as
i
said
these
accents
arent
all
identical
but
share
enough
characteristics
to
be
recognized
as
distinctly
native
derivative

i

even
used
prior

goes

at

perhaps
earlier
would
have
to
check
the

many
people
even
suggest
that
these
might
indeed
be
genuine
morphemes
with
wh
being
the
whquestiony
morpheme
of
english
qu
the
same
of
romance
languages
etc
so
that
you
would
analyze
morphologically
where
as
whloc
what
as
whthing
or
something
of
that
nature
i
think
this
is
the
smartest
explanation
ive
heard
so
far
in
the
comments
see

log
post

pullum
on
this
comic
well
yes
thats
one
of
the
first
things
anyone
learns
about
japanese
it
doesnt
mean
that
words
like
were
never
written
in
kanji
though
what
i
was
saying
was
that
the
use
of
has
an
etymological
base
because
looking
at
the
origins
of
the
words
and
their
meanings
their
etymology
each
word
implies
what
by
its
meaning
so
without
proof
either
way
of
their
origin
it
stands
to
reason
that
they
were
not
simply
written
as
what
act
what
way
what
by
or
what
time
by
coincidence
or
back
formation
that
could
be
an
incorrect
assumption
but
what
you
wrote
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
surely
youve
seen
some
creative
readings
of
kanji
yourself
for
instance
in
proper
names
mentally
challenged
yes
because
people
whose
occupation
is
pizza
are
going
to
be
perfectly
familiar
with
the
stupidities
of
the
eastern
seaboard
nobody
west
of
you
calls
it

not
any

im
familiar
with
anyway
and
i

i

metropolitan

below
are
links
to
some
relevant
articles
by
zuckermann
in
which
he
lays
out
the
details
of
his
argument
for
those
who
are
interested
in
the
details
1
first
is
the
most
general
article
easily
accessible
to
a
lay
reader
the
second
goes
into
more
detail
with
the
syntax
and
the
third
goes
into
extensive
detail
about
the
phenomenon
of
phonosemantic
matching
and
its
implications
for
the
lexicon
of
modern
hebrew
shalm
lakholl
if
im
understanding
you
correctly
i
believe
your
problem
with
the
section
is
that
he
claims
that
this
phenomenon
is
unique
to
arabic
i
agree
with
you
that
this
is
not
strictly
unique
to
arabic
most
world
languages
ones
which
have
substantial
numbers
of
speakers
have
some
degree
of
diglossia
as
well
as
dialectical
differences
even
english
has
this
but
the
part
that
makes
arabic
unique
is
the
degree
of
its
diglossia
and
its
dialectical
variation
the
differences
between
the
standard
and
the
spoken
dialects
is
nothing
short
of
radical
the
standard
usually
has
vso
word
order
while
most
dialects
have
svo
the
standard
is
a
highly
synthetic
language
with
case
endings
on
nouns
while
the
dialects
are
a
bit
more
analytic
and
lack
case
endings
the
differences
between
various
dialects
can
sometimes
be
very
significant
to
the
point
that
some
dialects
are
not
mutually
intelligible
with
one
another
its
still
considered
a
single
language
because
the
dialects
are
connected
in
a
kind
of
dialect
continuum
so
if
you
have
dialects
a
b
c
d
and
e
the
dialects
which
are
close
to
one
another
such
as
c
and
d
can
understand
each
other
but
the
dialects
far
from
one
another
such
as
a
and
e
cannot
moroccan
arabic
and
levantine
arabic
for
example
are
not
mutually
intelligible
the
former
shares
something
like
40
of
its
lexicon
with
quranic
arabic
while
the
latter
shares
maybe
70
of
its
lexicon
with
quranic
arabic
dont
quote
me
on
these
numbers
i
cant

the
source
where
i

advice
as
well
some
of
the

dont
forget
were
in

not

long

themselves
so
they
may
have
a
better
perspective
on

than
youd
expect
and
ditto
for
any

students
you
may
be
working

its

not

irish
then
its
gaelic
a
closely
related
yet
ultimately
distinct
language
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
youre
right
ive
been
studying
german
and
coincidentally
enough
many
of
the
resources
usually
hearken
back
to
how
german
and
english
were
of
similar
families
and
at
some
point
diverged
where
english
dropped
something
and
german
didnt
thanks
also
im
from
the
south
in
america
and
we
preferably
choose
to
use
yall
and
i
can
say
for
certain
we
use
all
of
yall
which
may
slur
into
allayall
though
yall
in
general
seems
to
be
unconfined
to
anyone
region
as
ive
heard
it
up
here
on
the
east
coast
and
west
coast
youre
the
one
claiming
theres
such
a
thing
as
mistakes
in
language
not
me
youre
the
one
who
needs
to
study
linguistics
and
open
your
mind
working
with
this
project
is
a
dream
of
mine
i
think
communication
between
species
is
the
first
step
to
a
full
understanding
of
our
world
sorry
that
last
comment
was
a
joke
intended
to
illustrate
that
language
is
always
changing
and
expecting
a
language
to
adhere
to
a
strict
set
of
rules
for
any
extended
amount
of
time
is
unreasonable
and
pretty
much
impossible
and
yes
i
would
imagine
most
pidgins
are
fairly
easy
to
use
since
by
definition
they
lack
much
grammar
whereas
aave
is
a
dialect
precisely
because
it
has
its
own
set
of
grammatical
rules
spend
the
time
id
love
to
hear
it
and
im
sure
many
others
in
this
sub
would
as
well
because
you
havent
said
anything
that
could
be
interpreted
as
true
yet
not
a
thing
you
dont
even
understand
a
damn
thing
about
aave
at
all
t
mn
lem
end
dont
bi
bz
t
j
she
has
it
in
all
the
prenasal
epsilons
i
think
its
a
characteristic
of
some
southern
dialects
but
usually
those
are
nonrhotic
id
guess
maybe
kentucky
tennessee
or
west
virginia
good
job
i
dont
know
the
last

im
mostly
just

absolutely
nothing
to

children
have
most
of
the
structure
of
their
native
language
down
by
age
3
or
4
agreed
with
some
structures
still
not
quite
fullcooked
eg
the
difference
between
a
maneating
fish
and
a
man
who
is
eating
fish
tho
this
example
involving
intonation
is
one
id
pick
children
as
learning
earlier
eg
2
yrs
old
rather
than
later
eg
4
yrs
old
i
remember
reading
about
a
child
pointing
at
a
car
saying
dad
car
to
mean
thats
dads
car
then
pointing
again
another
time
saying
dad
car
to
mean
dads
in
the
car
a
child
at
age
4
is
more
likely
to
not
know
a
man
who
is
eating
fishes
is
wrong
copular
sentences
were
included
in
the
lectures
on

in

i
took
theyre
not

semantically
empty
as
they
are

xkcd
comic
in
my
city
we
have
downtown
and
then
uptown
but
nobody
actually
calls
it
that
its
just
part
of
downtown
where
the
businesses
i
dont
know
work
together
to
drum
up
business
and
stuff
imagine
some
person
with
a
horrendous
disease
who
has
no
ability
to
aspire
to
anything
unless
theyre
climbing
a
mountain
that
is
to
say
they
have
to
climb
to
aspire
so
if
you
want
to
admonish
them
you
could
say
climb
to
aspire
yeah
regardless
of
your
perspective
on
missionary
work
you
cant
argue
with
the
fact
that
sil
has
been
very
important
to
field
linguistics
ethnologue
is
the
standard
in
language
reference
their
ipa
fonts
are
used
by
everyone
who
does
phonetic
transcription
and
their
software
toolbox
fieldworks
is
also
the
industry
standard
for
fieldwork
to
all
the
haters
sil
is
technically
not
a
religious
organization
they
do
linguistic
work
and
translate
the
bible
but
its
up
to
other
organizations
to
do
things
like
church
planting
documenting
languages
creating
an
orthography
and
teaching
the
people
to
read
it
are
central
to
preserving
languages
and
sil
is
doing
this
probably
in
greater
volume
than
any
other
organizations
thanks
unembedded
as
opposed
to
small
clauses
i
wonder
whether
all
the
types
mentioned
can
be
reconciled
within
one
typology
mmm
good
point
id
forgotten
about
that
who
only
wanted
to
learn
how
to
say
things
with
a
texas
accent
any
given
reasons
no
putting
dost
in
there
would
revert
knowest
to
infinitive
dost
thou
know
of
what
i
speak
thats
early
modern
english
actually
im
in
favour
of
reinstating
you
and
ye
as
the
plural
and
bringing
back
thou
and
thee
as
the
singular
for
all
circumstances
intimate
formal
or
informal
itd
be
great
if
everyone
could
just
agree
on
that
as
a
standard
and
save
everyone
in
the
future
much
confusion
playing
devils
advocate
here
using
they
as
a
genderless
singular
pronoun
is
much
more
objectionable
than
yall
the
only
reason
yall
is
considered
invalid
is
because
it
isnt
in
the
dictionary
on
the
other
hand
using
they
like
that
violates
the
rules
of
english
if
im
talking
about
someone
and
you
ask
who
is
they
that
will
always
be
jarring
unless
the
very
rules
of
our
language
are
changed
both
of
them
might
not
be
valid
objections
but
they
certainly
arent
equal
it
now
literally
means
figuratively
i
prefer
syk042s
observations
because
the
changes
he
mentions
where
a
word
basically
reverses
in
meaning
whom
who
and
ye
to
you
are
largely
simply
changes
in
grammar
ive
been
able
to
observe
this
as
a
nonnative
speaker
and
id
just
like
to
say
that
the
whole
process
has
been
really
really
cool
it
may
be
found
in
the

english
flawlessly
as
if
they
were
mentally
disabled
double
standards
from
a
prestigelanguage
group
say
it
aint
so
dots
really
if
you
look
at
reallife
logs
and
sticks
youll
find
that
they
are
actually
not
straight
thats
why
im
saying
that
the
straight
line
or
the
round
circle
are
mathematical
abstractions
taught
in
preschool
and
elementary
school
to
people
who
primarily
spend
their
time
indoors
being
inculturated
this
is
a
line
whats
shaped
like
a
line
a
stick
meanwhile
real
sticks
that
you
pick
up
off
the
ground
could
just
as
well
said
to
be
shaped
like
a
jagged
lightning
bolt
shape
than
a
straight
line
theyre
really
neither
each
is
a
valid
interpretation
same
deal
with
youre
circle
references
they
could
easily
be
the
oval
that
we
do
see
in
the
cave
paintaings
or
any
of
the
other
round
organic
forms
the
idea
that
they
naturally
would
be
representing
as
a
perfectly
round
circle
instead
of
the
imperfect
roundish
forms
that
they
actually
have
in
nature
seems
to
me
to
be
from
the
greeks
perfect
platonic
shapes
imprinted
on
imperfect
matter
creating
an
imperfect
form
these
paintings
were
done
by
people
who
primarily
spent
their
time
outdoors
hunting
scavenging
foraging
and
building
things
out
of
the
natural
elements
im
not
surprised
that
they
werent
painting
shapes
that
they
didnt
see
my
roman
history
is
definitely
questionable
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
roman
empire
was
plagued
by
lots
of
problems
including
corruption
and
italy
today
also
has
a
reputation
for
quality
products
and
a
rich
culture
anyways
youre
missing
the
point
i
think
we
should
be
looking
at
alternative
dialects
like
we
think
of
race
today
im
not
pushing
for
greater
use
of
aave
anymore
than
im
pushing
for
a
dramatic
increase
in
the
proportion
of
africanamericans
living
in
the
us
but
i
am
advocating
for
greater
acceptance
of
aave
much
in
the
same
way
that
we
have
progressed
on
matters
of
race
id
hope
that
you
wouldnt
say
that
more
black
people
intrinsically
means
a
higher
crime
rate
etc
because
there
really
isnt
any
basis
for
that
instead
broader
cultural
attitudes
towards
black
people
and
their
language
has
left
them
at
a
disadvantage
pushing
them
towards
committing
crime
as
a
means
of
getting
even
similarly
they
speak
a
different
dialect
simply
because
being
segregated
from
white
americans
in
ghettos
and
other
areas
for
hundreds
of
years
do
you
think
you
just
proved
something
there
are
constructions
that
are
ungrammatical
in
a
particular
dialect
or
idiolect
if
a
construction
is
grammatical
for
a
single
speaker
then
it
is
legitimate
and
grammatical
in
its
own
right
that
site
really
was
a
fantastic
find
and
i
have
been
going
through
it
particularly
the
vowels
its
already
helped
me
with
a
couple
things
since
its
hard
to
distinguish
between
a
dental
d
and
a
t
on
poor
digital
recordings
unfortunately
i
havent
yet
been
able
to
figure
out
the
missing
vowel
or
whatever
it
is
in
my
two
words
above
i
mostly
agree
with
afroelitist
above
for
the
first
word
but
the
second
am
still
not
sure
whats
going
on
in
the
middle
bridge
on
the
river
kwai
wow
at
least
two
months
since
last
time
someone
posted
this
song
by
adriano
celentano
it
may
be
a
record
you
misunderstand
so
very
much
that
it
will
be
hard
to
explain
it
in
a
way
that
will
make
sense
to
you
now
see
id
have
asked
soda
pop
or
cola
hehe
we
may
use
a
similar
phrase
to
dish
out
ive
actually
never
heard
it
before
in
my
life
i
apologize
if
i
come
off
as
snippy
i
thought
it
was
good
advice
because
tells
you
to
focus
on
practicing
transcription
after
picking
up
a
good
resource
since
i
thought
it
was
good
advice
i
wanted
to
know
why
someone
thought
otherwise
hell
im
not
even
trying
to
make
or
further
an
argument
i
give
your
novelty
account
6
points
reddit
gives
it

i
dont
know
what
things
are
like
in
the
us
but
here
in
australia
most
people
spend
the
first
4
years
of
high
school
fapping
about
doing
very
little
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
to
spend
one
term
on
say
the
history
of
the
english
language
or
something
like
that
recently
the
curriculum
has
been
reformed
to
include
more
grammar
after
the
government
finally
realised
that
people
dont
become
good
writers
by
passively
absorbing
the
skill
when
reading
the
requisite
one
book
per
month
during
english
class
at
a
glacial
pace
however
given
that
99
of
english
teachers
wont
have
had
any
training
in
linguistics
beyond
the
courses
they
will
have
taken
to
be
up
to
speed
enough
to
teach
basic
grammar
i
dont
think
this
will
have
much
of
an
effect
against
prescriptivist
attitudes
and
other
basic
misconceptions
its
fairly
new
but
definitely
used
in
many
contexts
eg
by
businesses
that
put
emphasis
on
being
pc
or
when
you
address
a
woman
in
writing
but
dont
know
her
marital
status
eg
the
only
indication
that
shes
a
woman
is
her
first
name
but
you
know
nothing
beyond
that
in
any
case
abbreviating
miss
into
ms
will
never
be
a
problem
even
though
you
remove
a
tiny
bit
of
information
the
other
way
round
interpreting
ms
as
meaning
miss
might
possibly
be
eversoslightly
problematic
in
rare
cases
i
worry
both
that
this
link
may
have
been
already
seen
by
those
who
can
appreciate
it
and
that
it
might
go
over
the
heads
of
everyone
else
if
so
apologies
nonetheless
specgrams
occasional
salvos
at
formalist
theoretical
excesses
always
make
my
day
even
when
reread
great
question
in
latin
sc
indicated
the
incohative
aspect
a
fancy
term
for
denoting
inceptive
verbs
these
verbs
include
adolscere
flrscere
crescere
all
of
which
mean
to
flowergrow
and
lapidescere
rubescere
to
hardenredden
other
verbs
in
this
class
are
likewise
intransitive
and
indicate
a
meaning
of
gettingbecoming
something
a
lot
of
these
remained
as
normal
ere
verbs
a
similar
incohative
construction
is
seen
in
the
verbal
spanish
prefix
en
like
enriquecerse
get
rich
and
enrojecerse
get
red
anyway
sometimes
the
sc
in
italian
verbs
like
pulire
only
surfaces
in
as
a
conjugation
except
1st2nd
plural
it
no
longer
indicates
that
aspect
for
the
verb
catalan
still
distinguishes
servir
but
this
is
lost
by
italian
no
all
dialects
are
equal
regardless
of
how
theyre
treated
having
prestige
does
not
make
a
dialect
more
legitimate
or
superior
its
also
because
all
of
the
sudden
is
perfectly
valid
and
extremely
widely
used
getting
to
the
point
where
you
can
talk
to
people
in
another
language
even
if
its
in
written
form
is
hard
plus
many
people
dont
want
to
deal
with
learners
we
bumble
around
mangling
their
language
making
mistakes
that
make
us
hard
to
understand
i
stopped
attempting
to
post
in
russian
forums
because
of
the
hostility
and
instead
just
lurked
and
eventually
stopped
lurking
because
the
forums
werent
that
interesting
when
i
wasnt
participating
im
not
a
linguist
but
i
feel
that
learning
french
had
additional
effects
beyond
providing
me
the
capability
to
speak
with
people
who
speak
french
that
ability
is
rarely
needed
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
1
i
think
that
the
process
of
learning
another
language
which
involves
a
lot
of
mapping
of
ideas
made
my
mind
more
nimble
for
other
somewhat
similar
learning
tasks
2
because
french
and
english
share
some
common
ancestry
i
feel
like
i
understand
and
express
myself
better
in
english
than
i
otherwise
might
im
not
really
a
linguist
merely
someone
who
finds
it
fascinating
amateur
linguist
then
i
guess
but
i
agree
with
this
both
in
terms
of
his
argument
and
in
terms
of
the
idea
of
assertionists
it
seems
to
me
that
a
lot
of
people
with
little
or
no
linguistic
knowledge
though
some
with
this
knowledge
do
this
as
well
tend
to
cling
to
the
grammar
they
were
taught
as
children
and
often
tend
to
argue
for
it
via
assertionist
claims
which
tend
to
amuse
me
im
a
nonlinguist
so
i
have
no
particular
standing
here
but
i
strongly
agree
let
me
slightly
rephrase
what
youre
saying
to
see
if
were
on
the
same
page
framing
the
issue
as
prescriptivism
v
descriptivism
is
itself
a
category
error
prescriptivism
is
something
which
operates
within
the
ordinary
use
of
language
descriptivism
operates
outside
it
they
dont
conflict
cant
conflict
any
more
than
having
an
opinion
about
which
breeds
of
rose
are
attractive
would
conflict
with
having
a
phd
in
plant
biology
prescriptivists
who
are
against
descriptivism
misunderstand
science
theyre
trying
to
apply
an
ought
argument
to
an
is
situation
descriptivists
who
are
against
prescriptivism
equally
misunderstand
science
prescriptivism
is
within
the
system
they
study
and
applying
value
judgments
to
it
is
equivalent
to
applying
value
judgments
to
vowel
shifts
the
exception
is
when
prescriptivists
claim
scientific
authority
this
is
a
lot
rarer
than
a
lot
of
linguists
who
get
upset
about
prescriptivism
make
it
sound
i
also
noticed
that
he
didnt
explain
that
the
interesting
thing
about
mirar
miru
and
marar
is
that
they
all
mean
to
see
and
attendre
means
to
wait
for
not
pay
heed
to
i
think
basically
hes
conflating
cognates
and
false
friends
i
dont
know
why
you
and
the
people
defending
you
are
getting
so
many
downvotes
he
must
have
a
bunch
of
accounts
or
something
you
know
id
be
curious
about
the
stats
on
polyglottery
among
linguists
for
example
are
minimalist
program
syntacticians
more
likely
than
other
linguists
to
be
monolingual
english
speakers
when
i
was
a
kid
and
would
fart
then
try
to
blame
it
on
someone
else
my
grandmother
would
say
the
guilty
dog
barks
first
i
still
use
this
one
im
16
and
we
still
use
it
all
the
time
here
people
on
omegle
have
short
attention
spans
and
disconnect
if
you
ask
too
many
questions
i
tried
asking
for
demographic
info
but
then
no
one
ever
responded
yeah
it
does
here
too
but
blowed
was
something
distinctly
different
from
blows
have
you
asked
in
resperanto
i
think
ill
just
drop
whatever
the
second
point
is
that
im
muddling
through
and
attempt
to
combine
themmy
thought
process
goes
along
the
line
of
this
noise
is
language
without
value
certain
aspects
of
music
have
a
universally
recognized
sentiment
therefore
certain
aspects
of
music
have
shared
value
between
a
group
in
that
way
music
overlaps
language
in
a
more
ambiguous
sense
and
thank
you
for
the
term
correctionslightly
embarrasing
universal
grammar
is
something
ive
been
selfeducating
on
recently
and
im
sure
ive
convoluted
its
basis
in
some
form
edit
some
grammar
formatting
more
precisely
i
could
care
less
is
now
used
to
mean
i
couldnt
care
less
what
ingolemo
siad
is
mostly
true
but
to
add
to
it
a
process
happened
in
english
called
trisyllabic
shortening
tss
basically
any
word
in
english
at
the
time
had
the
third
syllable
from
the
end
of
the
word
shortened
easily
visible
in
morphology
with
examples
liek
divine
only
two
sylables
so
unafected
by
tss
become
divinity
now
has
four
so
the
third
from
the
end
vin
is
shortened
you
can
also
kindof
see
this
in
neuropathy
o
is
shortened
and
neuropathology
the
o
from
before
is
no
longer
the
thirdsyllable
from
the
end
so
it
is
not
shortened
it
just
happens
to
be
the
case
in
this
example
that
another
o
is
examples
of
words
that
arent
affected
by
tss
do
exist
but
this
is
where
it
gets
complicated
certain
suffixes
are
invisible
to
tss
eg
the
hic
in
hiccuping
wouldnt
be
shortened
becuase
tss
doesnt
consider
ing
to
be
a
syllable
and
there
are
also
words
that
came
into
english
after
the
tss
process
was
complete
so
they
arent
affected
either
eg
the
vac
of
vacuuming
if
ing
counted
wouldnt
be
shortened
because
to
vacuum
wasnt
a
verb
in
17th
century
english
sorry
about
that
incredibly
bad
example
couldnt
think
of
any
better
maybe
maybe
not
but
as
a
student
of
japanese
i
sure
hope
so
ill
let
you
keep
both
syllabaries
the
phonotactics
of
your
language
is
wellsuited
to
syllabary
use
idont
follow
russian
adds
single
suffixes
to
nouns
and
double
suffixes
to
adjectives
that
indicate
case
clearly
i
must
go
and
scour
wikipedia
for
more
information
about
case
systems
or
perhaps
he
would
have
considered
it
a
cold
cut
no
bad
author
opinions
and
beliefs
do
exist
in
mathphysics
they
are
called
assumptions
linguistics
on
its
own
is
not
a
very
practical
major
there
are
some
related
fields
like
computational
linguistics
and
speech
language
pathology
that
have
more
jobs
but
outside
of
academia
these
are
not
in
general
very
linguisticsy
if
you
want
to
do
linguistics
expect
to
be
looking
for
a
job
in
academia
and
well
expect
there
to
be
loads
of
people
who
want
the
same
job
and
who
are
very
passionate
about
what
they
do
also
the
experience
of
learning
foreign
languages
while
it
can
be
sort
of
a
gateway
drug
it
was
mine
is
very
little
like
the
work
most
linguists
do
i
would
not
plan
on
going
into
linguistics
until
you
get
a
better
idea
of
what
its
like
so
you
think
japanese
or
whatever
is
really
cool
but
do
you
want
to
spend
months
of
your
life
researching
some
small
feature
of
japanese
and
attempting
to
explain
it
within
a
particular
theoretical
framework
do
you
want
to
stare
at
spectrograms
all
day
etc
it
takes
a
certain
amount
of
being
obsessive
to
be
an
academic
sometimes
sadly
at
my
uni
intro
linguistics
courses
are
generally
satisfy
a
math
and
science
general
education
requirement
which
would
be
redundant
for
someone
going
into
a
field
like
engineering
so
i
cant
even
really
suggest
to
take
an
intro
course
and
see
how
you
like
it
without
knowing
if
your
school
is
the
same
also
intro
courses
not
really
like
doing
linguistics
either
but
linguistics
is
cool
and
more
people
should
take
the
intro
course
so
they
at
least
have
a
better
idea
of
what
the
field
is
about
two
linguists
say
your
ancestors
i
didnt
realise
that
being
a
good
physicist
made
you
a
qualified
linguist
does
it
work
the
other
way
can
i
get
my
opinions
on
astrophysics
published
in
the
newspaper
my
research
indicates
that
invisibly
sky
bears
prop
the
stars
on
their
backs
speech
error
sounds
that
arent
really
words
but
negate
something
this
is
kinda
the
case
with
japanese
ashi
meaning
leg
and
ashi
meaning
chopstick
can
be
infered
with
the
context
they
also
have
hashi
with
an
expirated
ha
meaning
bridge
i
guess
that
by
saying
ashi
o
kudasai
you
can
get
from
the
context
that
you
mean
i
would
like
chopstick
and
not
i
would
like
your
leg
or
i
would
like
a
bridge
hashi
chopstickbridge
tone
deafness
has
a
strong
negative
correlation
with
belonging
to
societies
with
tonal
languages
this
could
be
evidence
that
the
ability
to
reproduce
and
distinguish
between
notes
may
be
a
learned
skill
id
drink
to
that
ive
been
around
plenty
of
good
elementary
school
music
programs
in
which
every
child
sings
on
pitch
and
ive
heard
that
in
certain
african
tribes
in
which
the
word
singer
only
means
one
who
is
currently
singing
and
the
concept
of
one
who
is
able
to
sing
vs
one
who
is
not
is
inconceivable
id
be
curious
to
know
if
the
authors
actually
talked
to
any
voice
teachers
most
of
us
feel
that
the
ability
to
distinguish
tones
is
innate
and
the
ability
to
reproduce
them
is
learned
naturally
unless
it
is
repressed
by
starvation
or
extinguished
by
shame
not
to
say
that
true
neurological
tonedeafness
doesnt
exist
just
that
its
a
lot
rarer
than
we
think
do
you
have
any
interesting
vowel
allophony
preceding
voiced
and
voiceless
environments
could
be
fun
to
check
with
ht
to
see
what
differences
you
end
up
with
thanks
for
all
your
help
ill
try
this
and
if
anything
improves
ill
be
sure
to
let
you
know
the
paper
you
linked
is
about
domainspecific
vs
domaingeneral
mechanisms
of
language
acquisition
i
dont
think
thats
what
op
is
interested
in
op
is
asking
whether
kids
can
learn
language
from
screen
media
hmmm
well
i
could
see
how
a
language
with
less
strict
word
order
that
allowed
topicalization
more
like
asl
would
have
less
need
for
prosody
in
information
structure
after
the
early
modern
english
period
roughly
shakespeare
uses
that
construction
often
aspd
might
be
easier
to
define
than
psychopathy
but
its
way
too
broad
a
term
for
useful
research
im
guessing
it
is
because
verbal
language
came
before
written
language
you
could
claim
that
a
standard
language
was
first
a
pidgin
based
on
its
dialects
unless
the
dialect
became
the
standard
like
in
french
its
then
easy
to
link
the
nativization
of
a
pidgin
to
a
creole
with
general
language
teaching
less
seven
years
in
the
usmc
from
1825
yes
as
is
joel
i
found
this
post
of
some
brits
presumably
discussing
the
distinction
ive
noticed
it
in
books
so
im
not
sure
if
it
follows
spoken
form
or
not
theres
also
body
language
at
work
if
you
can
see
the
person
heres
mine
no
sorry
i
was
being
serious
im
a
ling
noob
she
clearly
sounds
english
but
i
wasnt
really
picking
up
on
the
nonnative
aspect
thats
actually
kind
of
embarrassing
for
me
ive
lived
in
eastern
iowa
my
whole
life
and
have
never
pronounced
words
this
way
while
my
mom
is
from
eastern
iowawestern
illinois
and
pronounces
such
words
with
an
r
as
well
my
favorite
is
george
warshington
id
say
being
bilingual
or
fluent
in
another
language
can
affect
your
accent
a
bit
but
the
nativeenglishwhite20s30sness
also
influenced
my
thinking
no
idea
if
this
is
a
phenomenon
or
not
ive
just
noticed
that
some
of
my
friends
who
grew
up
in
a
bilingual
household
have
a
slightly
different
accent
sometimes
dont
bother
theyll
just
tell
you
the
same
thing
already
said
herebugs
are
technically
just
one
order
of
insects
but
people
keep
calling
everything
bugs
but
you
already
knew
that
too
thats
what
everyone
i
know
calls
them
here
in
ontario
canada
i
also
deliciate
obscure
words
too
maybe
you
can
corrade
a
new
list
of
them
yourself
in
the
meantime
dont
be
malagrugrous
prescriptivists
sometimes
claim
that
the
article
should
be
decided
by
the
noun
that
it
designates
rather
than
the
the
sound
that
follows
it

of

almost
any

tomar
specifically
means
to
drink
alcohol
in
addition
to
the
meanings
you
listed
tomado
is
commonly
used
for
drunk
as
well
as
hasta
la
verga
just
from
googling
around
its
almost
impossible
to
find
a
sourced
citation
for
this
claim
and
it
doesnt
appear
that
our
friends
over
at
language
log
have
tackled
this
one
as
they
have
laid
many
such
snowclones
to
rest
its
worth
pointing
out
that
the
tortured
reasoning
leads
most
of
us
to
view
this
skeptically
on
the
one
hand
eskimos
are
surrounded
by
snow
so
they
must
have
lots
of
words
for
it
but
on
the
other
hand
the
balinese
are
surrounded
by
art
so
clearly
they
must
not
have
any
words
for
it
but
even
if
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
protobalinese
had
no
word
for
art
thats
all
that
has
been
demonstrated
nothing
more
nothing
less
as
faithful
readers
of
the
language
log
are
quick
to
point
out
english
doesnt
have
a
word
for
lazy
hack
parroting
drivel
but
that
doesnt
stop
the
science
journalists
and
wikipedia
editors
from
impressing
us
day
in
and
day
out
english
is
my
second
language
been
in
the
us
ages
1030
and
id
call
myself
fluent
native
speaker
even
i
typically
dont
have
a
problem
understanding
british
accents
in
movies
but
when
i
tried
to
watch
the
office
uk
i
had
such
a
hard
time
that
i
ended
up
watching
it
with
subtitles
on
just
so
i
didnt
have
to
keep
rewinding
edit
korean
is
my
first
language
there
are
definitely
some
things
that
seem
to
cross
cultural
bounds
allowing
us
to
understand
symbols
as
mostly
arbitrary
but
affected
by
their
structure
ie
sound
symbolism
mimologics
by
grard
genette
goes
into
this
idea
a
great
deal
if
you
want
to
read
further
in
my
experience
when
bitch
is
applied
to
men
its
still
not
genderneutral
its
an
insult
to
his
masculinity
that
sounds
very
unique
to
me
nothing
i
ever
heard
of
theres
a
difference
between
being
unconvinced
for
scientifically
motivated
reasons
and
being
unconvinced
for
ideological
reasons
or
ignorance
the
majority
of
contentions
are
based
entirely
on
ignorance
and
ideology
not
actual
science
also
ive
my
many
specialists
in
acquisition
psycholinguistics
and
neurolinguistics
im
in
the
same
department
as
a
number
of
them
and
theyre
some
of
the
most
ardent
supporters
of
the
idea
of
ug
their
own
particular
flavors
i
got
that
part
thanks
thats
not
what
i
was
talking
about
in
all
seriousness
i
learned
it
with
andrew
carnies
book
i
would
be
interested
in
these
as
well
what
do
you
think
it
best
reflects
i
know
nothing
about
psycholinguistics
but
to
me
this
is
some
sort
of
sentential
spoonerism
kinda
thing
the
argument
that
it
is
more
correct
does
somewhat
stand
they
are
natives
of
the
american
continent
thus
native
americans
especially
since
here
the
word
indian
has
a
negative
undertone
so
people
prefer
native
american
so
to
me
the
argument
is
completely
valid
in
what
regions
is
that
grammatical
prick
verge
or
bite
is
feminine
not
to
mention
queue
and
pine
which
are
also
feminine
at
least
they
got
it
right
with
chatte
thats
also
related
to
judaism
the
beliefs
of
people
from
judea

my
favourite
or
the
phrase
ready
you
could
look
into
why
english
and
norwegian
has
svo
in
both
main
and
subordinate
clauses
and
german
has
svo
in
main
clauses
but
sov
in
subordinate
ones
and
how
negation
is
handled
in
the
midst
of
this
he
eats
strawberries
he
doesnt
eat
strawberries
why
he
eats
strawberries
why
he
doesnt
eat

i
think
the
elongated
cross
of
the
t
in
tes
is
supposed
to
also
serve
as
circumflex
its
generally
accepted
that
there
are
3
distinct
dialects
the
northern
dialect
that
doesnt
reduce
the
o
to
an
a
the
southern
that
reduces
but
also
pronounces
the
g
sound
as
a
x
and
the
eastern
that
reduces
the
o
and
also
occasionally
affricates
the
g
there
is
also
a
more
subtle
difference
between
spb
and
moscow
in
their
pronunciation
of
the
a
moscow
like
op
demonstrated
has
a
much
more
exaggerated
a
sound
there
are
also
some
minor
differences
in
word
choice
besides
those
there
are
the
kazak
and
tatar
dialects
influenced
by
their
languages
thanks
for
fixing
my
spelling
that
being
said
while
russian
may
have
cognates
that
are
similar
to
the
ukrainian
ukrainian
does
not
in
my
experience
have
the
same
cognates
so
maybe
a
russian
could
understand
ukrainian
but
neither
my
father
a
native
ukrainian
speaker
or
i
were
able
to
understand
the
russian
being
spoken
when
we
went
to
kyiv
ukraine
in
1993
when
we
asked
if
the
individuals
were
speaking
ukrainian
they
laughed
at
us
and
said
no
we
speak
russian
sorry
theres
also
the
possibility
that
the
form
of
uky
we
speak
is
anachronistic
having
been
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
native
speakers
in
ukraine
in
the
40s
i
came
here
to
say
this
english
doesnt
have
an
original
way
do
build
vocabulary
all
it
does
is
borrow
latin
words
and
apply
the
same
technique
as
all
romance
languages
the
original
thing
about
english
is
the
sound
system
and
the
pronunciation
of
words
the
form
ize
has
been
in
use
in
english
since
the
16th
century
the
alternative
spelling
ise
reflecting
a
french
influence
is
in
common
use
esp
in
british
english
aint
nothing
wrong
with
ize
and
it
is
in
fact
ise
that
is
the
recent
innovation
according
to
the
oed
if
youre
going
to
get
prescriptivist
up
in
here
at
least
do
so
with
a
nod
toward
etymological
accuracy
well
i
mean
i
would
hope
that
you
accept
that
kittens
dont
learn
language
while
kids
do
there
must
be
some
biological
ability
to
allows
for
kids
to
learn
language
and
this
ability
is
termed
ug
thats
all
ug
is
if
youre
asking
about
the
language
acquisition
device
or
fln
or
the
principles
and
parameters
model
with
the
minimalism
approach
then
these
are
all
different
and
separate
questions
but
ug
isnt
and
shouldnt
be
controversial
ahhh
the
forgotten
goatse
peoples
of
scandinavia
ask
axe
or
any
sport
for
that
matter
or
at
least
something
similar
this
makes
most
sense
to
me
to
hit
it
off
is
to
start
the
game
or
to
set
in
motion
the
rest
of
the
play
which
seems
to
be
the
context
in
which
hit
it
off
in
relationships
is
used
they
dont
do
it
well
no
they
do
do
it
well
1
at
my
university
linguistics
students
are
required
to
learn
2
foreign
languages
is
that
uncommon
the
wug
thing
seems
to
be
what
im
going
for
i
think
smileinducing
is
what
im
going
for
more
than
funny
thanks
omg
they
even
said
that
straits
salish
is
a
wakashan
language
i
guess
its
not
hyperbole
i
strongly
recommend
a
book
by
the
linguist
mark
baker
called
atoms
of
language
which
is
nontechnical
but
excellent
and
is
exactly
aimed
at
people
with
your
set
of
questions
its
on
amazon
for
about
14

4
used
yeah
i
was
just
thinking
about
this
the
other
day
that
in
some
ways
rage
faces
can
be
used
almost
like
lexemes
you
attach
a
face
to
a
word
or
sentence
to
give
it
additional
meaning
the
i
lied
face
is
the
most
concrete
example
effectively
acting
as
a
negative
and
i
could
imagine
it
being
analysed
the
same
was
as
the
popular
negative
construction
i
really
enjoyed
seeing
you
today
not
and
other
gotcha
discourse
types
everything
went
better
than
expected
is
another
one
that
can
be
added
graphically
to
a
statement
of
fact
to
add
to
it
the
meaning
that
the
event
decribed
was
a
positive
event
in
a
situation
where
a
negative
event
was
likely
forever
alone
is
interesting
in
that
it
functions
almost
without
words
most
usages
of
forever
alone
are
in
panels
with
no
other
words
and
in
many
cases
you
can
relate
these
faces
to
discourse
elements
as
you
say
okay
face
is
a
good
example
of
that
are
lus
and
a
ug
existence
independent
that
is
to
ask
can
we
derive
the
existence
of
one
from
the
existence
of
the
other
well
say
that
a
language
universal
was
recursion
then
the
ug
would
need
to
have
the
set
of
formal
grammars
with
the
computational
complexityability
to
perform
recursion
my
other
reply
talks
a
little
about
formal
language
theory
which
you
might
be
interested
in
i
cant
believe
i
actually
get
to
make
this
connection
ive
been
thinking
about
this
ever
since
i
saw
the
episode
and
i
think
they
got
it
exactly
right
if
youre
doing
a
final
on
this
phenomenon
youll
need
some
pop
culture
references
to
drive
the
point
across
if
you
have
the
time
i
highly
highly
recommend
watching
this
it
basically
predicts
what
natural
language
evolution
over
time
would
occur
if
a
society
began
to
communicate
in
these
macros
that
were
currently
seeing
surface
on
the
internet
the
episode
is
called
darmok
and
even
if
you
dont
like
star
trek
i
guarantee
that
watching
this
episode
will
help
you
or
at
least
give
you
some
material
to
write
your
paper
with
heres
the
wiki
on
the
episode
so
you
know
a
little
bit
what
to
look
for
you
may
be
tempted
to
just
read
the
wiki
but
seriously
watch
the
episode
otherwise
you
wont
know
what
the
communication
looks
like
first
of
all
i
think
that
clears
it
up
they
are
pretty
much
two
separate
clauses
and
as
youve
shown
they
can
be
mixed
and
matched
to
make
different
meanings
so
in
terms
of
the
students
just
making
a
sentence
as
in
not
getting
into
details
on
which
meaning
they
are
trying
to
express
it
doesnt
matter
which
one
they
put
down
i
think
that
will
satisfy
my
brain
lol
i
went
to
school
at
portland
state
university
and
i
only
attained
a
bachelors
so
i
forgot
a
great
deal
i
should
have
brought
my
ling
textbooks
with
me
to
japan
i
have
the
exact
same
problem
green
and
orange
but
i
really
only
screw
it
up
in
one
direction
just
dont
ask
me
which
one
it
is
i
also
cant
keep
former
and
latter
straight
without
thinking
it
through
quickly
every
time
but
thats
a
whole
other
thing
greek
is
an
example
that
proves
the
rule
yes
is
ne
which
can
be
a
source
of
confusion
for
learners
what
makes
it
even
worse
for
learners
is
the
accompanying
gesture
resembles
a
shake
of
the
head
bonus
marks
for
knowing
what
proves
means
in
this
expression
and
before
anyone
points
it
out
i
realise
that
n
for
negative
is
not
actually
a
rule
except
when
theyre
or
here
are
some
good
ones
little
late
but
im
going
to
throw
my
2
cents
in
with
a
caveat
i
did
my
ba
at
uncchapel
hill
and
it
was
amazing
how
wellprepared
i
felt
when
i
started
graduate
school
like
some
mentioned
about
ucsanta
cruz
the
core
courses
in
syntax
and
phonology
are
very
much
focused
on
you
building
up
your
grammars
from
the
ground
up
and
gradually
working
your
way
into
xbar
and
optimality
theory
respectively
and
since
its
a
small
program
the
graduatelevel
electives
are
open
up
to
undergraduates
the
professors
generally
modify
the
work
load
accordingly
i
should
note
thats
theres
pressure
to
start
doing
original
research
very
early
most
of
the
courses
i
took
had
final
projects
rather
than
finals
this
made
the
transfer
to
graduate
school
at
least
in
terms
of
coursework
very
very
easy
but
caveat
the
phd
program
just
got
cut
and
that
leaves
the
department
as
a
whole
somewhat
vulnerable
on
the
plus
side
in
terms
of
bangforyourbuck
you
cant
beat
unc
its
no
longer
cheap
if
youre
going
there
as
an
out
of
state
student
i
think
tuition
is
nearing
25000
a
year
it
was
closer
to
20000
when
i
started
6
years
ago
and
closer
to
15000
when
my
brother
went
there
3
years
before
me
yay
inflation
but
you
do
very
much
get
a
great
liberal
arts
education
for
about
half
the
price
of
a
selective
private
school
i
wouldnt
call
it
r
though
because
for
me
its
just
a
single
tap
on
the
alveolar
ridge
not
several
as
r
would
have
i
think
also
that
i
lengthen
the
vowel
before
the
flap
in
order
to
better
convey
that
ive
reduced
did
whats
the
difference
between
someone
exhibiting
signs
of
vocal
fry
and
just
having
a
raspy
voice
i
dont
even
seem
to
pick
up
on
people
doing
this
though
that
may
just
me
being
way
too
used
to
it
i
notice
noam
is
not
looking
at
the
camera
in
any
of
the
three
photos
maybe
in
my
experience
it
has
more
to
do
with
pitch
than
intensity
but
it
could
be
both
dutch
ssst
canonical
notation
or
ssht
usual
pronunciation
like
in
german
we
sometimes
say
pssst
but
thats
rather
to
get
attention
in
general
isnt
it
even
weirder
that
we
use
the
same
letters
for
different
sounds
but
the
entirety
of
what
he
wrote
implies
he
meant
universal
not
common
and
i
think
he
is
dead
wrong
on
that
count
if
thats
truly
what
he
meant
if
it
were
a
universal
in
the
languages
he
named
that
would
be
very
interesting
linguistically
and
psycholinguistically
and
possibly
pyschologically
and
sociologically
of
course
if
it
is
merely
common
in
at
least
some
major
languages
then
perhaps
there
is
nothing
to
explain
linguistically
and
it
reduces
to
either
a
question
of
effective
joke
telling
or
maybe
a
question
about
memes
as
he
suggested
note
that
the
question
of
which
tense
to
use
is
very
much
addressed
in
english
writing
courses
both
for
college
students
and
for
wouldbe
novelists
because
some
things
work
better
than
others
depending
on
purpose
all
of
which
is
very
interesting
but
not
about
linguistics
its
about
writing
effectively
similarly
the
ops
issue
is
an
interesting
one
i
just
doubt
that
it
is
about
linguistics
per
se
it
helps
when
you
dont
want
anyone
reading
what
youve
written
thats
awesomeso
irni
and
aryanic
are
the
same
word
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
sound
changes
in
between
its
not
unpc
to
hypothesize
that
a
linguistic
feature
is
associated
with
a
certain
social
group
thats
what
i
do
all
the
time
as
a
sociolinguist
as
long
as
there
is
no
superiorinferior
judgement
attached
its
just
observation
of
the
linguistic
reality
that
speech
communities
share
linguistic
features
and
also
often
form
around
socially
salient
characteristics
about
the
speakers
i
do
see
where
you
are
coming
from
but
if
you
saw
the
movie
shutter
can
easily
be
replaced
by
shudderas
thats
what
you
do
when
you
realize
how
far
into
insanity
the
protagonist
is
when
whats
happening
dawns
on
you
thats
why
i
assumed
the
title
of
the
movie
was
shudder
island
i
just
found
out
about
the
linguistics
subreddit
so
i
was
looking
through
some
old
threads
i
guess
what
i
was
getting
at
was
that
you
are
using
literally
and
like
together
while
one
only
speaks
to
veracity
and
the
other
to
specificity
the
construction
strikes
me
as
odd
to
say
that
there
are
truthfully
approximately
eight
cars
seems
strange
furthermore
why
would
you
even
use
the
word
literally
unless
what
follows
it
would
normally
have
cause
to
be
considered
hyperbolic
nothing
about
there
are
like
eight
exotic
cars
parked
in
front
of
my
house
strikes
me
as
particularly
unbelievable
on
its
face
i
suppose
there
is
a
reason
this
person
was
a
french
instructor
we
had
the
same
type
of
capstone
at
uw
our
language
was
min
im
not
even
going
to
bother
responding
to
this
whereas
kazegami
provided
an
interesting
ground
for
discussion
youre
the
equivalent
of
the
13yearold
screaming
fag
on
xbox
live
thats
how
i
do
it
to
for
me
words
arent
translations
theyre
synonyms
on
equal
footing
as
their
english
counterparts
oh
well
if
you
go
this
route
youll
be
getting
the
mainstream
perspective
there
are
a
lot
of
different
models
out
there
i
think
the
60
overlap
is
a
myth
that
just
wont
die
battison
1973
points
out
that
studies
show
a
much
lower
overlap
and
those
studies
are
loose
in
their
coding
again
i
havent
seen
any
actual
corpus
analysis
mostly
because
there
isnt
an
asl
corpus
right
now
ill
be
happy
to
be
proven
wrong
battison
1973
lexical
borrowing
in
american
signed
languages
arent
blends
only
a
subcategory
of
portmanteaux
i
thought
the
point
of
using
portmanteau
was
for
its
autonymicity
despite
not
being
a
true
blend
the
author
seems
to
miss
this
feature
of
the
word
if
most
people
are
saying
yes
then
i
guess
you
can
i
personally
wouldnt
though
without
the
context
i
dont
think
i
would
have
known
what
your
friend
meant
but
if
others
in
your
social
circle
know
what
he
means
then
yeah
its
probably
a
viable
construction
it
might
be
a
regional
thing
so
you
interpret
i
can
assure
you
they
are
not
mutually
intelligible
as
romance
languages
are
mutually
intelligible
you
are
either
a
troll
or
a
retard
im
going
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
assume
troll
cheers
i
recall
sociolinguist
dennis
preston
giving
a
talk
about
peoples
attitudes
to
certain
accents
he
referenced
a
study
of
his
that
said
that
people
generally
rank
denver
seattle
and
the
midwest
as
having
the
best
accents
new
york
the
south
rank
low
not
at
all
i
actually
made
the
joke
because
i
thought
english
was
your
first
language
well
done
thats
weird
the
e
ipa
symbol
refers
to
a
french
sound
in
bl
and
to
an
english
sound
half
of
the
diphtong
in
lay
and
those
two
sounds
are
nothing
alike
at
all
to
me
to
my
ears
the
sound
in
late
supposedly
e
is
the
exact
same
as
the
sound
in
let
unarguably
and
neither
could
be
said
to
resemble
the
sound
in
mang
except
maybe
if
you
speak
english
with
an
australian
accent
i
see
what
you
mean
english
e
and
are
slightly
lowered
compared
to
their
french
equivalents
meaning
you
could
mistake
a
french
for
an
english
e
but
different
languages
have
different
phonetic
realizations
of
similar
phonemes
just
look
at
english
and
french
low
vowels
english
has
pat
and
pot
while
french
has
a
patte
and
in
quebec
pte
in
addition
in
quebec
a
is
frequently
fronted
to
the
point
that
it
approaches
and
is
sometimes
designated
but
even
though
the
phoneme
symbols
may
be
the
same
the
phonetic
qualities
are
different
englishs
low
vowels
are
at
either
edge
of
the
vowel
inventory
with
a
fronted
and
a
frequently
backed
frenchs
low
vowels
however
are
concentrated
closer
to
the
middle
with
even
the
most
fronted
a
tokens
and
the
most
backed
tokens
more
centralized
than
the
english
equivalents
as
a
speaker
of
both
english
and
quebec
french
i
can
say
the
words
pat
patte
pte
pot
and
produce
four
different
vowel
sounds
even
though
they
can
be
symbolized
with
the
same
ipa
characters
dont
forget
that
the
two
languages
need
to
lack
a
dialect
continuum
for
example
northern
japanese
speakers
and
those
from
southwest
are
not
speaking
mutually
intelligible
dialects
but
due
to
the
dialect
continuum
down
mainland
japan
theyre
still
considered
a
single
language
however
when
you
have
a
sudden
break
in
the
dialect
continuum
such
as
uchinaaguchi
in
okinawa
its
a
separate
language
man
i
wish
i
lived
there
that
seems
like
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
learn
a
new
language
im
from
the
midwest
so
that
would
make
sense
i
havent
found
any
descriptions
of
midwest
accents
that
describe
a
shift
from
i
to
though
i
went
from
undergrad
straight
to
grad
in
part
to
defer
the
loans
i
had
from
repayment
i
started
working
in
the
field
while
in
grad
school
teaching
and
so
now
that
my
grace
period
for
the
loans
is
about
to
end
im
in
a
job
i
love
and
i
make
enough
to
actually
pay
the
loans
dont
be
afraid
there
are
loan
repayment
plans
that
are
based
on
your
income
at
the
time
that
are
pretty
sweet
and
cut
your
payments
by
about
75
depending
yeah
but
i
was
talking
about
how
native
new
yorker
misspelled
holland
as
hoilland
good
for
himut
belittle
everyone
who
a
doesnt
have
his
skills
and
b
doesnt
have
the
time
to
learn
at
least
six
languages
im
not
sure
what
his
thesis
is
or
why
he
gets
so
pissed
off
when
emails
dont
start
with
salutations
or
what
that
has
to
do
with
learning
loads
of
languages
still
if
he
actually
knows
as
many
languages
as
he
claims
to
hats
off
upvote
for
arguelles
his
tips
and
advice
have
given
me
the
basis
of
my
language
learning
techniques
and
routine
no
he
does
comprehend
the
grammatical
structure
script
idioms
etc
he
studies
for
hours
each
day
it
just
so
happens
that
none
of
it
involves
verbal
production
not
speaking
yourself
does
not
mean
you
dont
understand
dialogue
exasperation
actually
covered
this
pretty
perfectly
so
i
think
its
worth
quoting
him
at
length
unless
someone
has
either
have
some
sort
of
truly
stunning
intellectual
gift
or
a
trick
that
no
one
else
knows
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
anyone
could
acquire
true
competency
in
languages
as
quickly
as
would
be
necessary
to
be
able
to
speak
twenty
languages
its
either
hyperbole
or
operating
under
a
different
definition
of
able
to
speak
such
as
smalltalk
on
restricted
topics
and
being
able
to
read
formal
language
on
familiar
topics
with
a
dictionary
neither
of
those
count
as
far
as
im
concerned
though
by
arguelles
rubric
im
fluent
in
nird
and
occitane
god
i
sort
of
hate
looking
at
dutch
from
studying
german
for
two
years
its
like
i
can
feel
the
dutch
knocking
on
my
brain
and
being
like
yo
bro
u
mad
i
sorta
look
like
deutsch
but
not
reeeeally
you
took
the
words
right
out
of
my
mouth
or
abkhaz
and
some
other
caucasian
languages
are
particularly
scary
i
dont
see
why
he
just
doesnt
try
to
learn
one
of
those
rather
than
going
through
the
trouble
to
make
one
up
i
think
that
is
a
different
process
altogether
than
the
one
op
is
talking
about
i
believe
you
find
this
is
some
northern
dialects
eg
geordie
and
hes
sat
right
there
next
to
her
but
someone
can
correct
me
if
im
wrong
touche
you
joke
about
it
but
you
might
as
well
answer
someone
in
raskscience
with
something
completely
asinine
you
mean
step
into
your
shoes
no
thanks
i
like
being
sane
not
asinine
well
the
maritimes
is
indeed
very
distinct
phonetically
from
most
of
canada
though
the
canadian
raising
is
the
same
a
to
and
the
other
main
distinguishing
feature
of
canadian
english
to
is
found
there
as
well
the
latter
feature
is
shared
by
american
english
west
of
the
mississippi
and
for
some
odd
reason
in
pittsburgh
the
o
as
a
result
of
canadian
raising
is
not
found
anywhere
afaik
thanks
never
thought
of
it
that
way
historically
speaking
us
speakers
deleted
the
glide
after
alveolars
the
pronunciation
with
the
glide
is
the
more
conservative
one
this
goes
for
words
like
new
as
well
and
illusion
for
some
conservative
uk
speakers
north
american
english
still
features
the
glide
in
words
like
cute
and
pure
ninjaedit
also
its
definitely
not
a
prestige
thing
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
ipa
can
tell
you
that
nobody
lived
in
new
zealand
in
500
bc
if
youre
a
native
english
speaker
stressed
syllables
are
louder
and
longer
say
the
word
outloud
slowly
and
really
emphasize
the
syllables
that
feel
strong
or
like
you
should
put
emphasis
there
if
really
emphasizing
those
strong
syllables
sounds
good
then
thats
probably
a
stressed
syllable
another
thing
to
pay
attention
to
is
that
you
will
make
many
nonstressed
syllables
an
uhlike
sound
ie
schwa
thats
a
process
called
vowel
reduction
in
english
you
reduce
other
nonstressed
syllables
to
make
the
stressed
ones
pop
out
more
so
if
the
vowel
in
a
syllable
has
that
weak
uh
sound
thats
probably
not
a
stressed
syllable
if
youre
a
nonnative
english
speaker
youre
going
to
have
a
hell
of
time
determining
the
stress
of
a
word
based
on
your
own
pronunciation
if
your
pronunciation
isnt
accurate
in
this
regard
im
guessing
that
you
are
nonnative
a
native
speaker
should
in
generally
be
able
to
clearly
hear
intentionally
incorrect
stress
like
you
describedeither
that
or
youre
not
really
switching
the
stress
so
if
youre
nonnative
i
would
grab
the
nearest
native
speaker
and
make
them
say
the
words
for
you
telling
them
to
speak
slowly
and
add
emphasis
on
the
appropriate
syllables
then
listen
for
the
things
i
described
above
for
during
a
test
i
would
ask
youre
professor
if
youd
be
able
to
have
them
pronounce
the
words
for
you
during
the
test
so
that
you
can
determine
the
stress
based
on
their
pronunciation
rather
than
your
own
for
windows
how
about
photograph
and
photography
in
the
case
of
the
canadian
oneim
not
sure
that
native
peoples
or
aboriginals
was
used
sufficiently
in
a
pejorative
way
in
order
to
necessitate
the
next
step
on
the
treadmill
in
this
particular
case
to
my
knowledge
its
just
trying
to
stay
progressivecall
the
group
the
name
they
have
self
determined
as
opposed
to
assigning
one
though
who
in
the
group
decides
is
certainly
an
issue
but
im
not
in
a
part
of
canada
with
a
large
population
of
first
nations
peoplesso
it
might
not
be
completely
fair
for
me
to
say
i
could
query
my
friend
whos
up
in
yellowknife
and
see
what
he
has
to
say
about
this
rather
than
simply
arguing
semantics
can
you
please
elaborate
on
what
you
mean
by
learn
and
acquire
it
sounds
like
youre
just
drawing
a
completely
arbitrary
difference
so
that
you
can
say
but
children
are
different
without
any
evidence
this
is
kind
of
unrelated
but
how
does
my
three
year
old
go
from
my
feets
is
cold
to
my
feet
are
cold
well
at
the
age
of
three
your
child
should
understand
how
to
form
the
majority
of
the
grammatical
features
of
english
she
knows
that
when
youre
referring
to
more
than
one
thing
you
add
an
s
to
nouns
in
english
she
produces
feets
because
she
knows
recognized
and
generalized
the
plural
rule
but
not
the
irregular
exceptions
she
probably
analyzed
feet
as
being
singular
the
first
time
she
heard
it
since
it
lacked
the
s
plural
rule
she
knew
thus
you
hear
my
feets
she
will
probably
say
that
until
she
gets
new
information
to
correct
it
but
a
person
correcting
her
grammar
does
not
actually
help
99
of
the
time
so
for
example
maybe
she
knows
the
rule
that
nouns
following
both
have
to
be
plural
so
she
hears
give
me
both
of
your
feet
well
since
she
knows
the
rule
that
plurals
always
follow
both
she
now
understands
that
she
had
overgeneralized
the
plural
rule
before
and
has
reanalyzed
feet
as
being
plural
the
process
works
essentially
like
that
but
unconsciously
and
it
applies
to
the
verb
as
well
words
that
do
not
follow
the
general
patterns
of
a
language
are
usually
the
last
thing
in
a
childs
speech
to
be
corrected
does
it
come
from
my
correcting
her
grammar
when
she
says
it
or
from
hearing
other
people
say
it
enough
times
your
child
will
become
perfectly
fluent
in
her
language
no
matter
what
you
do
in
fact
i
very
strongly
discourage
you
from
trying
to
correct
a
childs
grammar
as
this
will
only
frustrate
confuse
and
stress
them
and
they
will
continue
to
use
the
incorrect
from
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
until
their
brain
is
ready
youre
much
more
likely
to
be
affecting
them
emotionally
than
linguistically
when
you
do
this
there
is
even
some
evidence
that
suggests
correcting
your
childs
grammar
is
a
hindrance
because
they
become
less
likely
to
try
and
produce
new
utterances
when
they
are
met
with
resistance
instead
of
understanding
as
a
redditor
im
sure
youre
familiar
with
how
frustrating
it
can
be
when
no
one
will
listen
to
what
youre
saying
and
is
instead
only
concerned
with
correcting
your
grammar
she
will
eventually
deduce
all
the
correct
forms
by
listening
and
unconscious
analysis
of
patterns
it
is
not
possible
to
stop
her
language
learning
in
any
way
without
depriving
her
of
most
or
all
social
contact
i
assure
you
if
spectrogram
analysis
shows
that
is
elided
then
its
elided
spectogram
analysis
of
two
voiceless
consonants
with
a
voiceless
vowel
in
between
wouldnt
show
anything
just
a
gap
if
hatsukoi
is
pronounced
differently
from
hatskoy
it
would
be
hard
though
not
impossible
to
see
on
a
spectogramthe
only
difference
would
be
the
length
of
the
gap
i
would
think
that
moraic
evidence
would
be
an
easier
way
to
determine
if
the
vowel
were
devoiced
or
deleted
well
its
a
late
night
ill
agree
to
disagree
for
me
these
words
dont
just
exhibit
a
change
in
the
final
consonant
but
the
vowel
length
changes
as
well
however
it
may
just
be
a
consequence
of
the
changed
consonant
the
vowel
is
long
before
a
voiced
consonant
and
short
before
an
unvoiced
one
since
vowel
length
isnt
a
distinctive
feature
in
english
whenever
spaniards
complain
about
people
outside
spain
speaking
spanish
i
just
tell
them
thats
what
they
get
for
trying
to
conquer
other
lands
shrug
well
apparently
ive
been
corrected
already
by
mordisquitos
but
i
think
your
reply
misunderstood
me
by
a
language
that
is
spoken
in
spain
i
mean
languages
that
are
situated
in
spain
it
would
be
like
me
claiming
that
a
sioux
indian
speaks
a
type
of
american
language
its
intriguing
and
i
dont
doubt
his
skill
or
competency
but
we
have
basically
the
work
of
one
man
to
go
on
id
like
to
see
more
evidence
i
recall
reading
in
brysons
mother
tongue
that
the
accent
of
shakespeares
time
sounded
far
more
irish
which
is
often
thought
of
as
sounding
similar
to
that
of
newfoundland
english
so
that
definitely
makes
sense
and
i
thought
the
same
thats
all
great
when
you
take
these
classes
think
about
which
ones
you
really
enjoy
and
make
you
excited
my
favorite
was
semantics
and
when
i
started
research
i
worked
under
a
semanticist
once
you
figure
out
what
you
might
like
to
do
look
through
the
uc
berkeley
websites
for
the
directors
of
the
labs
such
as
this
one
inquire
if
they
are
looking
for
any
new
research
assistants
and
if
so
how
you
can
apply
many
of
these
professors
you
will
have
in
class
so
if
you
particularly
enjoy
a
class
by
them
ask
them
if
they
need
any
research
help
make
sure
to
look
for
and
put
yourself
on
any
department
listservs
i
became
involved
in
research
because
a
professor
posted
a
listserv
blast
telling
everyone
she
was
looking
for
ras
for
her
new
lab
going
to
your
professors
office
hours
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
even
if
you
dont
have
questions
many
professors
are
very
willing
to
sit
there
and
chat
with
you
and
muse
about
the
subject
students
rarely
take
professors
up
on
office
hours
and
they
have
to
be
there
anyway
so
they
get
pretty
lonely
sometimes
if
you
dont
feel
like
you
can
strike
conversation
about
linguistics
yet
ask
questions
about
the
material
in
class
even
if
you
dont
have
any
problems
and
completely
understand
everything
pretend
that
you
either
dont
or
need
some
clarification
sure
youre
probably
right
i
tend
to
get
super
confused
about
this
one
of
my
major
downfalls
with
spanish
but
the
point
that
theres
a
literal
translation
might
be
helpful
for
the
instructor
ill
have
to
remember
those
natively
as
a
second
language
more
people
speak
english
utterances
and
turns
are
units
used
in
study
of
speech
sentence
is
more
of
a
textual
theoretical
and
syntactical
unit
used
in
other
kinds
of
linguistic
research
fullyformed
sentences
dont
really
occur
as
often
as
people
would
like
to
think
in
spontaneous
spoken
language
speaking
as
an
american
with
what
i
think
is
a
fairly
standard
accent
i
pronounce
google
as
gu
i
have
heard
in
my
time
these
past
few
years
living
in
louisiana
and
visiting
alabama
frequently
the
useage
of
like
j
im
not
an
expert
at
transcription
but
i
think
thats
a
fairly
good
representation
for
you
so
that
may
be
a
representation
of
you
living
on
the
fringes
of
the
southern
american
english
borders
then
again
you
do
live
in
west
viriginia
and
from
what
i
understand
though
im
no
expert
is
wv
can
get
kind
weird
linguistically
you
could
establish
the
existence
of
that
sort
of
recursion
in
piraha
just
by
looking
for
adverbials
that
come
after
the
embedded
clause
such
as
in
mary
said
that
joe
is
in
toms
house
yesterday
not
that
it
matters
either
way
chomsky
doesnt
mean
this
kind
of
recursion
when
he
talks
about
recursion
and
as
much
is
explicitly
stated
in
his
writings
so
whether
piraha
has
this
kind
or
not
is
irrelevant
are
you
being
serious
except
its
just
simple
german
with
an
english
accent
i
like
to
use
it
whomever
i
want
yup
we
use
genre
a
lot
too
il
tait
genre
i
currently
live
in
california
is
this
not
common
in
the
other
states
not
a
linguist
here
nor
do
i
know
the
answer
to
your
question
but
as
a
fluent
speaker
in
portuguese
there
is
an
equivalent
to
like
in
portuguese
they
use
the
work
tipo
which
means
type
its
usually
used
like
this
nao
sei
mas
tipo
assim
foi
muito
legal
i
dont
know
but
like
it
was
really
cool
tipo
eh
meio
feio
like
its
sort
of
ugly
just
wanted
to
share
no
its
a
different
phonological
process
dropping
rs
is
sort
of
a
misnomer
it
isnt
like
youre
forgetting
to
say
them
they
just
arent
present
in
new
england
dialects
of
english
in
certain
phonological
circumstances
saa
table
if
im
not
mistaken
someone
correct
me
if
im
wrong
is
more
like
a
contraction
if
it
were
a
similar
process
to
r
dropping
youd
probably
see
other
things
being
shorted
in
other
circumstances
in
other
words
youd
see
something
like
pure
la
becoming
paa
which
although
im
not
very
familiar
with
a
quebecois
accent
almost
certainly
doesnt
happen
my
two
cents
someone
speaking
aave
african
american
vernacular
english
might
not
become
president
of
harvard
true
but
someone
with
an
oxford
england
accent
is
not
going
to
be
a
worldfamous
gangsta
rapper
different
dialects
reflect
different
cultures
with
different
emphasis
on
different
things
while
black
english
is
currently
a
language
of
the
ghetto
protospanish
was
as
well
back
in
the
14001600s
in
spain
all
of
the
prominent
scholars
spoke
latin
spanish
was
the
language
of
the
street
folk
there
was
no
literature
in
spanish
there
were
no
politicians
who
spoke
it
it
took
playwrites
and
artists
to
appeal
to
the
uneducated
masses
until
there
was
literature
in
early
spanish
and
now
look
at
it
official
language
of
like
twenty
countries
the
problem
with
prescriptivists
is
that
they
refuse
to
look
at
any
time
period
other
than
their
own
and
only
the
immediate
50
years
do
they
think
jesus
came
down
speaking
websters
prescribed
english
how
is
it
so
hard
to
realize
that
languages
split
and
merge
and
change
all
the
fucking
time
more
fun
facts
the
majority
of
english
words
that
arent
frenchlatin
in
origin
like
cow
pig
chicken
fuck
shit
etc
etc
were
the
words
of
the
common
folk
the
poor
and
unwashed
of
the
british
isles
after
the
invasion
of
the
french
french
was
the
proper
language
at
that
time
you
couldnt
be
a
politician
or
a
scholar
if
you
spoke
english
so
yeah
call
it
proper
english
all
you
want
fuck
you
we
have
an
arbitrarily
defined
professional
english
that
is
based
on
the
educational
tools
we
export
so
as
to
aid
international
commerce
and
stuff
a
kid
raised
in
some
poorass
ghetto
in
the
south
faces
crazy
social
pressure
to
not
act
rich
or
white
or
to
aspire
to
much
its
socially
crippling
to
try
and
not
speak
the
way
the
people
who
are
around
you
speak
you
think
a
kid
who
speaks
like
obama
is
going
to
not
get
the
shit
kicked
out
of
him
all
of
his
life
if
hes
born
in
the
bronx
are
you
retarded
i
could
go
on
justify
your
belief
that
all
aave
speakers
dont
contribute
to
society
as
much
as
you
want
blame
the
individuals
because
obviously
every
3
year
old
kid
has
the
ability
to
make
that
decision
starting
today
i
speak
the
kings
english
so
common
your
viewpoint
comes
from
privilege
ignorance
and
superiority
aave
speakers
have
accomplished
things
and
they
will
and
within
a
few
generations
good
luck
understanding
the
majority
of
what
theyll
say
its
diverging
get
over
it
edit
also
wanted
to
point
this
out
think
of
ones
language
like
a
religion
bear
with
me
here
for
now
basically
we
all
understand
that
a
persons
religion
is
100
based
on
their
familycommunity
until
they
are
old
enough
to
start
critically
thinkinglearning
about
other
cultures
in
a
similar
vein
ones
language
is
based
100
on
the
language
of
the
family
and
the
community
saying
that
black
people
need
to
understand
that
they
should
learn
standard
english
in
order
to
contribute
to
society
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
all
jews
should
realize
that
you
cant
do
anything
in
america
unless
they
convert
to
christianity
sure
some
people
will
convert
on
paper
just
to
get
by
or
whatever
but
you
are
insulting
your
heritage
admitting
that
your
family
and
community
is
lesser
than
the
ruling
class
purely
because
of
something
beyond
any
one
persons
control
linguistic
discrimination
is
in
my
eyes
no
different
than
racial
or
religious
discrimination
i
dont
teach
them
about
wanna
just
gonna
like
you
said
too
many
inherent
problems
in
wanna
a
nonnativeenglishspeaker
once
said
to
me
im
gonna
the
shop
having
been
taught
gonna
i
make
sure
to
tell
them
to
change
going
to
to
gonna
only
when
its
an
auxiliary
not
a
main
verb
relevant
he
seems
to
differentiate
between
real
alphabets
and
others
im
wondering
if
arabic
counts
or
hindi
the
former
rather
than
the
latter
those
are
good
but
they
dont
specifically
imply
a
name
theres
a
length
difference
as
well
though
on
top
of
the
quality
difference
tense
vowels
are
most
of
the
time
somewhat
longer
than
lax
vowels
its
just
that
the
difference
in
length
is
a
lot
smaller
than
in
other
languages
where
the
vowels
contrast
only
in
length
not
quality
so
its
more
important
to
have
a
clear
length
difference
in
other
languages
its
apparently
a
21
ratio
while
in
english
you
only
get
a
131
ratio
so
its
not
incorrect
to
call
them
long
and
short
vowels
its
just
that
its
describing
only
one
of
the
dimensions
on
which
they
differ
that
hypercorrection
has
been
around
a
long
time
my
mother
always
uses
it
and
it
took
me
till
i
got
to
the
university
before
i
figured
out
it
was
weird
since
then
for
the
last
35
years
i
have
heard
it
everywhere
and
it
always
drives
me
nuts
its
amazing
how
many
popular
songs
use
i
in
object
position
so
i
guess
my
pet
peeve
is
hypercorrection
due
to
prescriptivism
this
again
firstly
what
you
downloaded
is
not
what
they
currently
sell
what
they
sell
teaches
you
how
to
read
and
write
and
it
also
includes
online
sessions
with
native
speakers
in
immersion
briefly
it
is
a
very
good
program
for
romance
languages
germanic
languages
and
chinese
assuming
the
student
is
a
native
english
speaker
it
is
deficient
in
other
languages
but
is
still
an
excellent
tool
since
it
allows
you
to
1
hear
correct
utterances
spoken
by
native
speakers
2
compare
your
pronunciation
to
native
speakers
with
spectrograms
3
converse
with
native
speakers
as
much
as
you
want
although
its
limited
by
the
contents
of
the
course
unless
you
get
a
coach
willing
to
go
offscript
it
is
designed
with
the
romance
languages
in
mind
pretty
clearly
spanish
so
what
you
get
out
of
it
for
another
language
will
depend
on
the
knowledge
you
have
of
the
grammar
of
that
language
as
it
relates
to
spanish
or
english
i
have
used
it
for
french
chinese
dutch
spanish
arabic
russian
and
italian
and
i
have
a
degree
in
china
studies
with
distinction
and
b2
certification
in
french
i
like
it
because
its
a
great
way
to
memorize
a
good
foundation
relatively
painlesslybut
i
can
say
with
certainty
it
alone
will
not
get
you
functioning
comfortably
in
arabic
not
that
this
fact
has
stopped
me
from
using
it
in
conjunction
with
other
resources
nor
will
it
get
you
fluent
or
functioning
in
russian
by
itselfalthough
with
good
grammar
explanations
again
its
a
fantastic
tool
in
your
toolkit
that
said
the
price
can
be
an
issue
for
most
people
then
again
what
you
downloaded
was
likely
version
2
which
everyone
complains
about
but
i
absolutely
adore
since
its
a
metric
shitton
of
correct
sentences
and
covers
an
almost
insanely
ambitious
amount
of
vocabularybut
it
does
start
slowly
i
use
it
more
as
a
reference
by
checking
the
lesson
headers
in
english
to
find
material
that
interests
me
in
other
languages
sources
i
worked
for
them
for
3
years
drank
the
koolaid
and
learned
all
of
their
products
inside
out
after
learning
the
product
better
than
99
of
the
employees
and
watching
the
company
treat
the
employees
like
shit
i
got
out
it
could
have
been
a
great
company
that
kept
improving
its
product
until
nothing
could
touch
them
but
instead
they
went
public
and
are
apparently
trying
to
run
the
company
into
the
ground
any
other
specific
questions
let
me
know
im
canadian
and
the
only
conventions
ive
ever
seen
here
are
40000
typically
used
by
anglophones
and
40
000
typically
used
by
francophones
also
pass
on
my
compliments
to
the
designer
of
the
webpage
i
think
its
rather
well
designed
the
linguistlist
is
a
good
place
to
find
jobs
for
efl
and
it
gives
you
links
you
can
use
to
get
further
informationapplication
info
not
exactly
related
but
i
once
had
a
professor
say
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
to
a
phoneme
from
its
own
perspective
is
to
turn
into
an
f
because
that
can
lead
to
turning
into
h
and
then
eventually
disappearing
you
may
be
onto
something
old
people
are
both
more
racist
and
also
use
such
language
or
should
that
be
the
old
i
think
the
issue
there
is
that
the
ukraine
makes
it
sound
like
a
territory
instead
of
a
country
what
university
teaches
canadian
french
thats
so
cool
i
had
to
jump
through
a
lot
of
hoops
over
the
past
decade
to
learn
to
talk
like
a
quebecker
the
page
on
wikipedia
is
a
good
start
the
normans
might
not
be
the
best
example
im
not
entirely
sure
but
i
think
the
insular
normans
ended
up
dropping
out
of
contact
with
the
continental
normans
i
think
ops
post
is
partially
inspired
by
the
perception
that
the
immigration
of
spanishspeaking
peoples
into
the
country
is
different
from
previous
groups
that
this
group
is
larger
more
geographically
ubiquitous
and
somehow
more
resilient
ie
they
strongly
retain
their
native
cultures
and
language
while
past
groups
poles
germans
italians
irish
were
quick
to
forget
their
heritage
and
assimilate
into
white
american
english
culture
this
is
a
perception
ive
noticed
among
both
spanish
and
english
speakers
im
suspicious
of
this
perception
personally
it
might
be
true
that
this
is
the
largest
immigrant
group
weve
ever
seen
dont
know
the
statistics
but
i
think
if
you
went
back
and
looked
at
the
firstgeneration
immigrants
of
other
groups
youd
find
that
they
tend
to
form
communities
publish
newspapers
start
restaurants
tend
towards
certain
occupational
niches
etc
just
like
the
current
latino
population
is
i
think
youd
also
find
a
lot
of
people
talking
about
whether
a
given
group
would
ever
fully
assimilate
thats
not
to
say
that
the
current
latino
population
will
ultimately
be
overcome
by
mainstream
english
culture
i
think
its
hard
to
see
from
our
presentday
standpoint
how
past
language
groups
merged
and
i
think
even
linguisticssavvy
people
would
be
surprised
but
i
think
ops
question
comes
from
the
shock
of
language
populations
meeting
more
than
a
real
possibility
of
a
more
spanglishy
english
but
fesses
is
only
really
used
in
cases
where
youre
talking
specifically
about
the
cheeks
if
you
had
to
translate
butt
into
french
you
would
almost
definitely
translate
it
as
cul
hes
looking
for
a
language
where
there
is
singular
word
for
butt
but
rather
only
a
plural
word
referring
to
both
cheeks
thanks
the
difference
totally
went
over
my
german
head
until
i
read
your
post
also
common
here
in
rural
oregon
judging
by
every
guys
opinion
ive
ever
talked
to
youd
change
your
mind
if
you
got
to
hear
me
then
honestly
i
think
i
sound
stupid
and
weird
but
for
some
reason
every
guy
so
far
has
told
me
how
beautiful
and
other
rather
inappropriate
things
i
sound
ive
always
disagreed
and
i
honestly
dont
know
what
it
is
but
like
i
said
i
myself
think
any
foreign
accent
doesnt
sound
good

and
that
includes
my
own

do
you
have
a
link
to
that
it
sounds
fascinating
no

congrats
other
people
have
said
this
but
i
think
i
can
put
this
plainer
many
expressions
from
one
language
are
calqued
from
another
language
a
relatively
recent
example
many
spanish
dialects
that
have
had
substantial
contact
with
english
have
calqued
the
english
expression
call
back
as
llamar
para
atrs
this
expression
is
routinely
condemned
as
spanglish
by
prescriptivists
who
insist
on
the
use
of
devolver
la
llamada
return
the
call
about
sweden
was
that
recently
quite
simply
sweden
didnt
have
much
in
the
way
of
any
official
language
policies
until
about
10
years
ago
despite
being
fairly
progressive
in
terms
of
attitudes
towards
them
since
the
1960s
for
instance
since
1968
elementary
school
children
have
been
offered
education
in
their
home
language
hemsprk
later
changed
to
modersml
native
language
but
that
legislation
never
distinguished
between
immigrant
languages
and
minority
languages
or
even
against
swedish
itself
sweden
didnt
recognize
its
official
minority
languages
until
a
decade
ago
and
swedish
itself
didnt
become
the
official
language
of
sweden
until
2009
so
strangely
enough
sweden
had
official
minority
languages
before
having
an
official
majority
one
theres
been
an
increase
in
sami
programming
since
i
think
eg
the
coproduced
osat
finnishlanguage
broadcasting
in
sweden
dates
back
much
earlier
though
late
1960s
in
radio
daily
tv
news
since
the
1980s
some
childrens
programming
too
im
not
so
sure
about
menkieli
since
thatd
probably
be
local
broadcasts
japanese
uses
the
same
word
for
ahead
and
behind
in
some
senses
saki
thats
as
close
as
i
could
come
the
thing
is
you
can
whisper
in
chinese
and
it
is
understandable
try
reading
the

next
time

one
thing
that
is
like
your
question
though
is
that
theres
a
word
for
cross
cousin
where
the
closest
relatives
arent
the
same
gender
including
the
gender
of
the
egothis
means
that
the
term
refers
to
different
types
of
cousins
for
a
male
or
for
a
female
there
are
also
kinship
terms
which
only
males
use
and
which
only
females
use
an
interesting
analysis
by
a
guy
who
pretty
obviously
doesnt
actually
know
much
about
old
japanese
first
off
hes
writing
the
oj
out
as
if
its
modern
japanese
despite
massive
sound
changes
he
gives
the
sentence
warewa
imo
omou
this
is
not
western
old
japanese
classical
japanese
maybe
but
certainly
not
from
the
time
period
he
claims
that
it
is
from
in
the
manysh
this
sentence
occurs
only
once
but
it
is
written
out
completely
in
chinese
characters
so
to
rewrite
it

i

further
there
are
tons
of
examples
of
the
accusative

marker
being
used
in
old
japanese
vovin
2009
even
goes
over
the
fact
that
it
can
sometimes
be
used
as
an
absolutive

if

then
ill
actually
have

i
can
comment
much
more
and
if
its
about
the

which
vovins
excellent
two

grammar
doesnt
deal
with
then
it
may
end
up
being
a
useful
addition
to
the
study
of
premodern
japanese
edit
i
forgot
to
mention
you
are
also
allowed
to
drop
the
accusative
case
marker
in
modern
japanese
and
pick
any
languagedialect
in
the
north
ryukyus
and
youll
see
a
japonic
language
that
really
doesnt
have
an
accusative

1
omp
should
have
only
schwas
mp
but
there
is
no
evidence
for
the
initial
os
being
schwas
in
oj
everything
is
written
in
capitals
because
it
is
written
semantographically
1
the
attributive
attr
is
a
form
which
means
among
other
things
the
verb
modifies
the
following
parts
vovin
2009
this
contrasts
with
the
final
form
which
ends
the
sentence
vovin
2009
so
for
example
kuru
pt
comeattr
person
the
person
who
came
vs
pt
ku
person
comefin
the
person
came

omp
omp
is
misspelled
as
omp
omop
here
its
likely
the
scribe
either
spoke
a
dialect
of
oj
that
had
merged
o
and
or
was
writing
so
late
ie
in
middle
japanese
that
they
had
merged
the
presumption
that
the
person
or
organisation
holding
power
was
more
important
isnt
quite
accurate
this
balance
has
really
been
in
a
state
of
flux
for
some
time
take
europe
between
3000
bc
and
500
ad
for
instance
this
was
the
golden
era
of
city
states
empires
either
a
force
was
a
confedaracy
of
individual
city
states
with
a
variety
of
means
of
governnance
or
it
was
an
empire
administered
from
a
city
from
which
the
entire
empire
got
its
name
compare
say
the
carthaginians
to
the
egyptians
to
the
greeks
to
the
romans
the
emphasis
changed
somewhat
during
the
dark
ages
with
administrations
often
being
removed
from
the
comercial
entities
hiding
away
in
fortresses
at
this
point
your
base
proposition
is
somewhat
correct
but
not
entirely
usually
with
exceptions
like
the
venetian
empire
nations
governments
were
coined
by
their
dynasty
family
name
take
the
hapsburgs
for
example
the
problem
here
for
your
proposition
is
this
didnt
refer
to
the
way
they
governed
or
the
state
they
governed
merely
the
fact
that
they
did
the
hapsburgs
transcended
nation
governnance
to
control
a
number
of
empires
at
various
periods
in
history
with
the
advent
of
the
nation
state
the
revolutionaries
creating
these
new
more
modern
entities
were
usually
the
powerful
mercantile
classes
in
the
larger
cities
take
london
paris
for
example
in
the
holy
roman
empire
the
successor
states
this
is
less
clear
indeed
even
after
the
unification
of
germany
there
is
no
clear
and
consistent
capital
but
i
dont
think
people
really
referred
to
london
or
paris
in
the
sense
of
governance
because
prior
culturally
for
them
government
had
been
an
external
oppressive
force
and
their
subsequent
democracies
and
republics
were
more
a
reflection
of
their
middle
class
desires
then
an
attempt
at
replicating
old
ideas
of
government
so
i
guess
here
it
had
been
somewhat
separated
from
the
notion
of
the
city
but
the
characters
involved
werent
so
important
as
the
type
of
system
in
britain
they
would
refer
to
westminster
or
parliament
or
the
house
of
lords
etc
the
idea
of
a
prime
minister
is
actually
pretty
recent
in
the
context
of
all
of
this
i
guess
the
experience
though
in
the
colonial
revolutions
evolutions
is
probably
more
consistent
with
using
the
capital
city
to
refer
to
government
in
australia
the
usa
purpose
built
cities
cater
to
federal
government
these
became
associated
with
the
seat
of
government
more
then
anything
else
and
in
some
senses
modern
european
nations
have
followed
this
model
in
noneuropean
cultures
its
all
over
the
shop
china
depending
on
the
dynasty
associated
123
or
no
cities
with
the
seat
and
operation
of
government
depending
on
the
importance
of
centralisation
emperor
even
within
dynasties
this
has
seen
a
state
of
flux
take
the
transition
from
mao
to
ziang
zemin
for
example
not
only
was
the
government
in
the
50s
thought
of
as
maos
but
an
entire
political
philosophy
which
unironically
deemphasised
the
importance
of
the
individual
to
history
is
based
on
his
name
that
for
many
rural
indians
nepalese
cambodians
albanians
etc
makes
the
use
of
his
name
character
supragovernmental
in
concept
while
now
modern
beijing
and
its
bustling
beauracracy
is
considered
the
heart
of
chinas
government
rather
then
either
of
its
pseudo
heads
of
state
i
think
the
question
really
is
what
word
is
relevant
to
which
regime
tempered
by
the
existing
relevance
of
the
city
to
a
distant
chinese
official
beijing
is
a
faraway
concept
and
full
of
government
to
a
scot
london
is
the
financial
and
industrial
capital
of
the
old
empire
while
westminster
is
still
the
seat
of
federal
government
for
the
time
being
to
a
canadian
washington
might
indeed
represent
some
minor
rebellious
colonial
outpost
they
tried
to
burn
down
a
while
back
when
the
empire
was
still
proud
and
full
chested
after
reading
through
this
thread
a
bit
more
i
see
that
youve
narrowed
down
the
gramaticality
of
double
negs
to
aave
south
american
and
british
dialects
but
i
want
to
point
something
out
in
the
midwest
us
double
negs
are
also
commonly
used
though
only
in
very
colloquial
speech
and
often
among
children
i
also
recall
a
time
when
a
waitress
in
northern
wisconsin
told
me
we
aint
got
no
buckwheat
pancakes
so
this
usage
seems
to
be
quite
common
while
not
very
popular
i
feel
as
if
it
takes
more
processing
time
kind
of
related
to
the
principle
of
maximum
relevance
because
of
a
semantic
ambiguity
and
is
understood
by
all
speakers
but
not
preferred
im
not
going
to
give
you
an
intro
class
on
linguistics
you
can
do
that
on
your
own
time
the
short
of
it
is
that
the
source
of
standard
prescriptions
comes
from
a
mishmash
of
historical
usage
idiosyncrasies
of
authors
and
style
guides
and
misguided
efforts
to
force
english
to
fit
with
latin
rules
pretty
riduculous
considering
that
english
is
a
western
germanic
language
ironically
often
nonstandard
variants
are
able
to
increase
precision
and
utility
by
filling
the
gaping
holes
left
by
the
standard
forms
eg
no
distinction
between
singular
and
plural
second
person
and
ignoring
the
useless
prescriptions
eg
no
split
infinities
the
double
negatives
and
the
idea
of
the
split
infinitive
simply
arent
there
on
prepositions
prepositions
have
government
of
cases
and
in
english
they
always
require
the
objective
case
after
them
as
with
him
from
her
to
me
the
preposition
is
often
separated
from
the
relative
which
it
governs
and
joined
to
the
verb
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
or
of
some
member
of
it
as
horace
is
an
author
whom
i
am
much
delighted
with
the
world
is
too
well
bred
to
shock
authors
with
a
truth
which
generally
their
booksellers
are
the
first
that
inform
them
of
this
is
an
idiom
which
our
language
is
strongly
inclined
to
it
prevails
in
common
conversation
and
suits
very
well
with
the
familiar
style
in
writing
but
the
placing
of
the
preposition
before
the
relative
is
more
graceful
as
well
as
more
perspicuous
and
agrees
much
better
with
the
solemn
and
elevated
style
but
in
english
the
preposition
is
more
frequently
placed
after
the
verb
and
separate
from
it
like
an
adverb
in
which
situation
it
is
no
less
apt
to
affect
the
sense
of
it
and
to
give
it
a
new
meaning
and
may
still
be
considered
as
belonging
to
the
verb
and
a
part
of
it
as
to
cast
is
to
throw
but
to
cast
up
or
to
compute
an
account
is
quite
a
different
thing
thus
to
fall
on
to
bear
out
to
give
over
c
so
that
the
meaning
of
the
verb
and
the
propriety
of
the
phrase
depend
upon
the
preposition
subjoined
thats
not
a
rule
its
a
minor
stylistic
suggestion
whilst
admitting
that
its
not
required
in
normal
english
and
that
great
poets
dont
use
it
pope
was
considered
greater
in
those
days
than
now
all
on
google
books
here
also
just
searched
for
negative
and
couldnt
find
anything
on
doubles
as
i
recall
from
my
linguistics
course
at
university
that
died
out
after
anglosaxon
chaucer
usually
has
two
negatives
canceling
each
other
out
i
did
not
say
i
disagreed
with
you
i
asked
if
you
had
evidence
to
support
your
claim
that
the
community
itself
has
chosen
to
create
a
memeless
environment
and
not
just
yourself
be
careful
with
things
like
that
calling
a
woman
fraulein
in
germany
will
get
you
some
very
nasty
looks
and
also
heres
an
npr
story
on
the
initial
push
last
year
to
get
rid
of
mademoiselle
with
a
relevant
quote
as
long
as
no
one
calls
me
monsieur
im
fine
she
says
anyway
we
naturally
refer
to
an
older
unmarried
woman
as
madame
and
if
you
youre
married
but
dont
look
your
age
you
might
get
called
mademoiselle
its
flattering
one
way
and
less
so
the
other
but
thats
life
she
says
and
speaking
from
personal
experience
im
currently
the
contact
person
for
a
conference
i
dont
have
my
phd
yet
and
i
would
prefer
that
the
emails
come
to
ms
seabasser
but
ive
gotten
some
miss
and
mrs
seabasser
and
was
slightly
annoyed
as
i
have
issues
with
both
terms
in
a
professional
setting
personal
life
is
a
little
different
because
whose
business
is
it
what
my
marital
status
is
anyway
i
completely
understand
that
its
inappropriate
for
legal
usage
but
in
everyday
life
like
being
a
cashier
and
saying
hello
to
someone
the
very
fact
that
those
two
words
are
used
sometime
brighten
my
and
somebody
elses
day
i
agree
its
time
for
it
to
leave
from
formalofficial
uses
but
it
should
never
leave
from
everyday
informal
use
i
am
aware
of
fraulein
sounding
a
bit
juvenile
though
but
where
im
from
gospodina
slovenian
has
a
very
nice
tone
and
meaning
behind
it
it
has
a
very
similar
sound
and
meaning
to
it
as
mademoiselle
i
like
to
use
it
sall
that
does
seem
more
precise
indeed
but
what
do
you
expect
from
a
journalist
the
guygals
probably
never
even
heard
the
term
used
in
its
natural
environment
until
a
few
days
before
writing
this
piece
same
im
in
mississippi
if
its
just
thrown
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
im
not
sure
that
i
would
say
it
much
differently
besides
drawing
out
the
r
at
the
end
if
i
say
each
one
individually
there
is
definitely
a
clear
distinction
i
wanted
to
know
whether
rhotic
speakers
pronounced
them
differently
i
did
not
know
the
answer
to
this
question
therefore
i
asked
it
plus
many
older
indoeuropean
languages
relied
heavily
on
morphology
to
indicate
number
case
difference
whereas
most
of
their
modern
counterparts
have
slowly
begun
to
use
more
affixes
usually
suffixes
to
show
these
differences
an
example
or
morphological
difference
for
plurals
man
vs
men
an
example
of
a
suffix
for
plurals
boy
vs
boys
if
you
look
to
icelandic
which
is
a
modern
language
and
relatively
unchanged
from
old
norse
it
has
an
extremely
complex
morphological
and
case
system
navajo
was
hard
and
then
i
tried
to
learn
hungarian
even
as
a
native
bilingual
finnish
speaker
i
found
hungarian
ridiculous
i
have
actually
been
in
this
situation
several
times
each
time
we
started
by
identifying
nouns
and
pronouns
once
you
have
done
that
you
learn
a
few
verbs
usually
with
just
a
subject
i
eat
objects
dont
come
till
much
later
word
order
is
never
a
problem
in
my
experience
the
hard
part
is
trying
to
grasp
the
concept
of
an
abstract
word
one
which
cant
be
acted
out
i
like
you
chaschbi
is
a
swiss
german
diminutive
form
of
kaspar
because
i
havent
stated
my
gender
on
facebook
it
refers
to
me
as
they
which
i
think
is
amusing
also
you
should
look
up
the
spivak
pronouns
for
a
slightly
awkward
alternative
you
are
so
right
it
brings
out
the
wackos
how
do
you
know
they
didnt
hurt
the
tree
you
animal
lovers
are
treeist
indeed
linguists
saying
that
we
shouldnt
call
slang
ungrammatical
or
incorrect
is
ironically
prescriptive
of
them
i
cant
quite
get
my
head
around
this
comment
linguists
say
that
to
call
informal
usage
incorrect
or
ungrammatical
is
prescriptivist
so
we
are
being
prescriptivist
for
pointing
out
prescriptivism
my
head
hurts
dont
most
university
programs
require
you
to
take
more
than
one
language
to
major
in
linguistics
though
more
than
one
no
although
id
guess
youd
have
to
take
at
least
a
year
of
one
foreign
language
it
is
bull
i
was
just
trying
to
sound
a
bit
inspirational
make
it
look
like
its
a
piece
of
cake
but
seriously
given
one
entire
year
youd
be
able
to
learn
a
new
language
with
less
than
4
hours
a
day
just
immerse
yourself
in
the
language
watch
movies
listen
to
music
watch
cartoons
anything
i
learned
a
bit
of
finnish
by
just
listening
to
a
very
good
finnish
band
and
then
watching
a
couple
of
finnish
tutorial
vids
its
very
hard
to
actually
become
fluent
but
its
a
start
some
languages
lack
vocabulary
andor
the
grammatical
tools
to
express
some
ideas
some
languages
have
larger
vocabularies
but
when
a
language
needs
a
word
it
generally
borrows
one
over
50
of
english
vocabulary
is
borrowed
if
a
speaker
is
educated
in
a
certain
field
that
speaker
will
gain
the
needed
vocabulary
as
a
consequence
of
education
no
matter
what
language
it
is
imparted
in
no
human
language
lacks
the
grammatical
tools
to
express
any
possible
idea
the
bottom
line
speakers
have
all
the
vocabulary
and
grammar
needed
to
express
any
idea
of
any
complexity
which
they
might
need
to
express
as
they
need
to
express
new
ideas
in
a
given
language
the
language
expands
to
meet
the
needs
of
its
speakers
it
happened
to
english
and
it
happens
every
day
to
languages
everywhere
speakers
are
never
constrained
by
their
language
call
me
ahaha
i
like
how
someone
exerted
the
effort
to
downvote
me
for
this
was
it
you
was
it
because
you
already
called
me
and
its
no
longer
relevant
oh
god
its
ratheism
all
over
again
heres
an
idea
lets
apply
science
to
arrogant
snarky
rants
and
find
out
how
effective
they
really
are
at
changing
your
oppositions
opinions
so
give
us
a
short
paragraph
describing
the
adventures
of
the
timetraveler
i
wont
judge
you
on
the
creative
writing
aspect
i
am
not
a
speaker
of
aae
however
the
link
in
my
earlier
post
clearly
demonstrates
the
scope
of
aae
aspect
possibilities
which
encompasses
and
extends
the
tense
and
aspect
possibilities
of
sae
i
think
this
sufficiently
proves
the
point
especially
since
if
i
were
to
obtain
an
aae
version
of
your
scenario
you
most
likely
wouldnt
understand
it
and
aave
is
a
ridiculous
euphemism
anyway
its
not
a
euphemism
it
is
a
name
for
the
language
variety
in
question
i
should
add
that
many
linguists
who
work
on
the
language
at
present
prefer
aae
to
aave
however
i
do
know
of
one
linguist
who
maintains
a
distinction
between
aae
and
aave
i
dont
know
what
is
euphemistic
about
describing
the
language
variety
spoken
by
african
americans
as
african
american
english
it
seems
pretty
straightforward
to
me
normality
is
not
a
value
judgment
its
a
frequency
judgment
it
does
not
require
any
leap
to
say
that
people
who
try
to
correct
others
by
offering
an
opinion
at
odds
with
the
facts
of
the
language
as
they
are
rather
than
what
some
might
wish
they
were
are
advocating
against
a
commonplace
phenomenon
im
going
to
bangor
for
the
l2
prosody
workshop
which
is
at
the
end
of
march
ill
have
a
talk
with
the
people
there
and
it
might
end
up
going
to
the
summer
school
im
most
interested
in
the
icall
one
by
meurers
then
again
i
may
not
end
up
going
seeing
that
theres
nothing
exclusively
on
l2
phonology
acquisitiondidactics
its
just
a
result
of
the
same
sound
changes
that
destroyed
the
latin
case
system
the
phonology
is
french
is
perhaps
the
most
changed
of
all
the
romance
languages
also
many
nouns
have
an
extra
consonant
in
the
pluralspoken
as
for
other
european
languages
that
have
similar
tendencies
andalusian
spanish
sometimes
only
shows
plurals
by
a
tenselax
vowel
harmony
la
casa
la
casa
las
casas
la
casa
this
is
mostly
a
result
of
s
aspiration
and
the
later
loss
of
the
h
anyone
mind
explaining
the
great
vowel
shift
one
to
a
nonlinguist
i
did
change
didnt
it
if
someone
thinks
listen
to
science
and
accept
that
it
is
normal
is
the
same
as
listen
to
science
and
accept
that
it
is
common
they
have
basic
comprehension
issues
engaging
in
discussion
is
unlikely
to
be
fruitful
i
cant
remember
any
examples
but
a
while
ago
i
started
reading
a
very
interesting
book
on
gender
i
think
it
was
this
one
by
corbett
which
mentions
inquorate
gender
it
seems
that
this
can
refer
to
any
gender
that
has
only
a
few
memberssuch
as
one
that
takes
different
agreement
for
plural
than
would
be
expected
from
the
singular
the
examples
given
on
page
173
look
like
the
same
phenomenonfor
instance
the
word
for
document
switching
gender
in
the
plural
you
might
consider
checking
that
book
out
for
more
info
there
isnt
much
else
i
can
find
on
the
internets
its
a
grammatical
mistake
that
makes
me
itchy
its
so
easy
to
remember
lie
lay
lain
so
why
cant
they
get
it
right
its
the
most
widespread
mistake
among
educated
people
no
source
just
an
opinion
and
script
writers
you
hear
it
on
tv
in
speeches
everywhere
also
i
suffer
from
insomnia
this
rule
is
generalised
to
all
feminine
nouns
beginning
with
a
eg
agua
water
agua
ist
just
a
very
very
particular
case
i
have
not
yet
seen
a
rule
that
explains
it
but
would
really
like
to
see
one
many
many
nouns
that
behave
normally
exist
la
alegr
la
ansiedad
la
agon
la
armon
etc
pp
first
things
first
the
word
used
in
linguistics
is
dialectal
dialectical
is
a
word
from
philosophy
relating
to
a
style
of
argument
i
think
that
southern
double
and
triple
modals
constitute
a
good
example
of
this
an
explanation
can
be
found
here
it
allows
for
a
more
efficient
expression
the
possessive
structures
differ
a
bit
in
american
and
british
english
british
speakers
tend
to
use
have
got
where
have
is
more
common
in
american
english
i
used
to
teach
english
overseas
and
used
a
british
textbook
which
informed
the
students
that
have
alone
in
a
declarative
sentence
was
wrong
yet
the
same
book
taught
the
students
to
say
have
you
a
pencil
and
i
havent
a
pencil
structures
which
americans
would
probably
find
odd
if
not
ungrammatical
my
advice
to
students
was
when
in
doubt
use
have
got
which
is
acceptable
in
both
varieties
unless
of
course
you
are
talking
about
the
past
participle
british
english
uses
have
got
for
the
past
participle
while
american
english
uses
have
gotten
yup
basically
what
a
troll
does
thats
why
trollface
is
always
smiling
im
glad
youve
got
such
a
sound
theoretical
grasp
of
what
youre
doing
but
im
still
not
a
fan
i
meant
exactly
what
i
typed
his
assertion
was
blatantly
stupid
some
accents
have
two
sounds
sorry
i
misread
his
comment
and
thought
he
was
sarcastically
saying
the
subreddit
was
classy
because
of
downvotes
you
might
have
none
was
referring
to
the
number
of
downvotes
not
upvotes
there
is
no
present
tense
in
english
i
read
books
is
this
happening
right
now
not
at
all
it
describes
a
habitual
activity
if
you
want
to
show
something
is
currently
happening
you
use
the
progressive
aspect
be
ing
which
indicates
an
ongoing
activity
and
can
combine
with
past
tense
as
easily
as
with
nonpast
there
is
no
tense
marker
to
show
an
activity
is
happening
in
the
present
once
again
english
has
two
tenses
past
and
nonpast
there
are
some
literary
criticism
theories
that
i
can
only
think
about
in
spanish
my
second
language
because
thats
how
i
learned
them
i
have
to
actively
translate
back
to
english
if
i
want
to
talk
about
them
i
guess
im
just
used
to
living
in
the
liberal
bastions
of
the
northeast
the
worst
ive
heard
is
when
people
use
masculine
pronouns
for
transwomen
and
vice
versa
if
you
want
to
know
about
the
birth
words
you
can
also
study
emerging
protolanguages
like
homesign
or
nicaraguan
sign
language
my
masters
project
is
on
the
emergence
or
maybe
nonemergence
of
lexicons
among
nicaraguan
familybased
homesign
systems
asking
what
constitutes
a
beautiful
word
phrase
etc
is
like
asking
what
art
is
ellen
dissanayake
defined
making
art
as
making
special
or
removing
something
from
its
original
context
and
adding
this
quality
making
special
is
also
my
answer
to
the
second
part
of
your
question
mostly
because
im
unable
to
think
of
art
as
anything
else
but
that
since
reading
it
im
sorry
but
those
papers
are
garbage
the
first
papers
shows
that
children
can
learn
the
unlearnable
words
so
that
experiment
disproves
the
theory
the
nonconservative
determiner
does
not
fit
the
english
grammar
so
of
course
its
more
difficult
to
learn
than
the
conservative
one
but
at
least
some
children
succesfully
learned
it
so
its
not
unlearnable
the
second
paper
is
completely
nonsensical
i
love
asking
this
question
to
anyone
learning
languages
while
there
is
nothing
inherently
beautiful
in
any
word
or
phrase
we
do
make
them
that
way
my
favorite
word
in
spanish
is
ultima
its
the
feminine
form
of
the
word
for
last
and
i
think
it
just
sounds
brilliant
also
in
vietnamese
my
favorite
phrases
are
u
and
y
which
are
simply
where
and
here
vietnamese
is
an
incredibly
fun
and
different
language
to
speak
in
hungarian
i
really
like
the
word
szerbusz
which
sounds
like
serboos
and
means
both
hello
and
goodbye
this
an
older
form
of
hungarian
salutation
today
they
often
use
szia
but
the
older
version
was
the
one
my
grandfather
used
all
the
time
when
he
was
alive
and
was
the
last
thing
i
ever
said
to
him
its
my
favorite
by
far
theres
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
with
ethnic
varieties
in
the
us
pennsylvania
dutch
in
iowa
is
losing
the
dative
case
as
is
potentially
yiddish
in
nyc
but
whether
or
not
english
is
responsible
for
those
changes
is
up
for
debate
after
all
english
doesnt
have
the
dative
case
outside
of
the
pronominal
system
but
languages
do
lose
their
cases
some
times
for
other
reasons
i
remember
reading
something
about
some
phonological
changes
in
either
korea
or
japan
that
may
have
come
in
via
massive
amounts
loan
words
from
english
but
i
dont
remember
the
exact
details
it
isnt
just
contact
but
this
is
only
somewhat
true
there
has
been
plenty
of
language
change
since
the
invention
of
the
printing
press
it
might
have
worked
to
slow
language
change
certainly
but
it
didnt
bring
it
to
a
near
halt
which
become
somewhat
meaningless
in
the
monoculture
of
the
21st
century
not
true
at
all
or
not
universally
true
at
least
within
the
united
states
for
example
there
is
plenty
of
language
change
going
on
regional
dialects
are
becoming
more
distinct
not
less
crappyninja
edit
in
case
you
want
something
to
listen
toread
that
discusses
this
for
sure
and
what
happens
when
we
can
no
longer
be
isolated
unless
someone
invents
warp
drive
or
an
ansible
thats
not
relevant
for
the
case
with
mars
are
we
having
this
conversation
in
the
20th
century
or
the
21st
oh
sorry
youtubepodcasts
rolls
eyes
kids
cant
learn
language
from
tv
that
just
seems
very
dumb
on
its
surface
dumb
tho
it
may
seem
we
know
this
is
true
kids
cannot
learn
the
core
of
language
grammar
phonology
morphology
from
tv
real
human
contact
is
required
but
youre
right
about
your
child
i
shouldve
rephrased
that
kids
are
like
adults
in
what
they
will
learn
from
tv
as
someone
who
has
learned
more
than
one
language
second
language
acquisition
as
an
adult
is
demonstrably
not
the
same
as
first
language
acquisition
as
a
child
adults
never
attain
native
level
competency
in
grammar
and
rarely
attain
native
level
competency
in
the
phonology
unless
theyre
either
quite
gifted
or
have
explicit
training
in
the
phonological
phenomena
involved
your
examples
of
secondlanguage
english
learning
from
tv
is
nothing
more
than
what
i
described
slang
is
a
lexicon
a
collect
of
words
and
turns
of
phrase
which
is
precisely
what
i
said
adults
can
learn
from
tv
huh
thats
kinda
cool
and
would
explain
the
missing
wu
in
classical
japaneses
w
row
and
i
guess
youre
right
i
had
implicitly
assumed
that
we
had
speakers
for
languages
we
were
examining
the
orthography
of
when
the
language
were
looking
at
is
dead
or
evolved
beyond
recognition
of
course
orthography
is
all
we
have
and
we
can
learn
about
eg
the
great
vowel
shift
from
orthography
because
there
are
no
more
native
eme
speakers
left
to
give
an
example
closer
to
home
im
not
sure
why
you
think
thats
pedantic
can
you
please
expand
on
that
a
little
more
fully
voicedprevoiced
stops
can
occur
in
initial
position
in
english
but
i
would
say
its
more
in
careful
speech
which
would
certainly
include
dictionary
sample
pronunciations
more
often
theyre
only
partially
voiced
in
initial
position
i
would
consider
these
much
more
naturalsounding
pronunciations
of
initial
and
medial
b
clip
1
or
3
on
this
page
and
clip
9
on
this
page
im
not
going
to
attempt
to
tell
you
precisely
what
the
voicing
is
in
those
clips
since
im
not
a
phonetician
educating
the
deaf
in
reading
english
doesnt
always
happen
successfully
its
not
really
surprising
think
of
learning
an
entirely
new
language
with
no
spoken
feedback
the
fact
that
so
many
deaf
people
can
read
and
write
english
well
is
a
real
accomplishment
im
not
even
going
to
bother
reading
it
ill
just
judge
it
blindly
no
it
doesnt
i
hate
to
go
all
prescriptivist
on
you
but
they
are
gricean
maxims
named
after
hp
grice
nothing
to
do
with
greeks
at
all
i
dont
think
anyone
other
than
linguists
would
intentionally
use
a
wrong
word
order
but
if
someone
did
it
would
have
to
be
the
manner
maxim
they
were
breaking
i
just
completely
lost
it
holy
goddamn
fuck
i
would
love
to
hear
from
professor
francis
nolan
on
his
construction
of
parseltongue
but
thats
really
just
the
nerd
in
me
when
we
lose
a
language
we
lose
human
wisdom
and
knowledge
we
lose
one
view
of
our
world
that
may
be
nonrecoverable
see
the
poet
in
me
wants
to
agree
with
you
but
you
saying
this
doesnt
make
it
any
more
true
linguistics
is
supposed
to
be
about
inquiry
im
asking
how
do
you
figure
id
like
to
ask
harrison
thats
why
i
put
him
on
my
list
of
course
theres
a
spelling
mistake
but
in
the
case
of
should
have
versus
should
of
it
seems
to
be
generational
and
therefore
language
change
not
a
spelling
error
younger
speakers
tend
to
write
should
of
esperanto
is
exempt
from
critique
as
all
languages
are
exempt
from
critique
again
as
ive
said
multiple
times
the
fact
that
its
an
attempt
at
an
auxlang
is
irrelevant
linguistically
im
curious
about
the
dialect
regions
illustration
from
the
atlas
of
north
american
english
that
accompanies
the
article
first
im
still
struggling
to
get
a
handle
on
what
is
meant
by
dialect
so
its
not
clear
to
me
in
what
sense
these
regions
represent
different
dialects
second
and
this
is
likely
related
to
my
first
point
of
confusion
how
is
the
south
dialect
being
described
or
defined
it
surely
cant
be
by
accent
or
there
would
be
far
more
regions
outlined
this
is
likely
true
for
all
other
regions
too
but
im
more
familiar
with
southern
accents
so
the
grouping
struck
me
as
particularly
peculiar
esperanto
has
l1
speakers
it
is
therefore
a
natural
language
despite
its
odd
origins
it
is
similar
in
this
respect
to
revived
languages
which
lacked
l1
speakers
for
a
time
then
regained
status
as
living
languages
the
fact
that
these
l1
speakers
do
not
form
a
community
is
irrelevant
again
either
make
linguistically
relevant
comments
or
stop
pestering
you
continually
speak
about
auxlangs
but
for
the
final
time
such
things
are
irrelevant
in
the
field
of
linguistics
we
study
languages
not
auxlangs
the
status
of
a
language
is
irrelevant
but
the
language
itself
is
and
all
languages
are
equal
move
along
oh
thanks
i
figured
i
couldnt
possibly
be
the
first
person
to
have
brought
this
up
i
would
never
as
a
native
say
the
malefirst
versions
unless
there
was
some
sort
of
emphasis
placed
on
uncle
or
grandpa
or
auntgrandma
was
an
afterthought
it
sounds
strange
to
my
ears

they
exist
but
im
too
lazy
to
look
for
them
to
make
sure
they
match
i
think
because
it
seems
to
mimic
the
general
sound
of
speech
in
the
same
way
that
a
word
like
rhubarb
does
the
latin
word
for
foreigner
is
barbarus
where
we
get
the
word
barbarian
and
many
believe
that
the
etymology
of
the
word
is
romans
mimicing
the
uncultured
speech
of
tribes
they
came
across
fighting
in
gaul
even
2000
years
ago
their
barbar
is
quite
similar
to
blah
blah
of
course
its
possible
thats
a
false
etymology
its
more
likely
that
it
stems
from
the
latin
word
barbus
meaning
beard
romans
were
mainly
cleanshaven
so
a
younger
man
having
a
beard
would
have
been
a
sign
of
a
nonroman
the
sound
has
been
around
long
before
america
was
a
country
not
sure
if
ive
heard
it
although
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
strange
to
summon
is
a
transitive
verb
subject
summons
object
most
transitive
verbs
can
be
turned
into
a
noun
and
adjective
with
the
ing
suffix
the
killing
an
annoying
man
the
summoning
summoning
summons
summoningly
adjective
noun
verb
adverb
cool
ill
definitely
check
it
out
thank
you
in
aave
do
is
used
with
negatives
in
sentences
with
habitual
be
as
in
things
dont
be
like
that
compare
the
regular
nonhabitual
negative
aint
so
i
would
guess
that
influences
the
use
of
do
here
thank
you
that
was
really
helpful
im
just
slightly
nervous
about
being
out
of
my
depth
and
not
understanding
the
jargon
theyre
throwing
at
me
i
am
but
a
selftaught
undergrad
after
all
also
you
teach
esl
i
got
really
excited
when
i
read
that
because
lately
ive
been
contemplating
pursuing
a
grad
degree
in
applied
ling
with
the
intent
to
eventually
teach
esl
so
id
actually
love
to
bombard
you
with
questions
sometime
if
youd
be
so
kind
thats
fascinating
thanks
good
question
maybe
this
convention
could
fit
under
the
umbrella
of
a
snowclone
but
that
seems
to
be
missing
some
of
the
point
viewing
the
way
you
typed
it
which
feels
correct
to
me
has
me
wondering
if
it
might
be
an
old
typists
convention
perhaps
used
by
secretaries
taking
dictation
its
completely
different
on
either
side
of
my
house
large
differences
even
across
my
bed
one
day
i
fell
asleep
on
the
wrong
side
and
woke
up
with
uvular
rs
i
did
a
paper
on
the
near
extinction
of
the
breton
language
it
was
pretty
interestingdepressing
to
learn
about
how
the
french
oppressed
regional
languages
and
i
fully
agree
with
this
statement
the
germans
did
not
have
enough
time
to
implement
a
lot
of
changes
to
the
language
the
french
established
the
acadmie
franise
as
well
in
order
to
guide
the
language
and
keep
it
proper
i
spent
some
time
in
france
northern
mostly
and
the
accents
do
vary
a
lot
but
this
was
as
stated
above
only
due
to
regional
languages
turning
into
regional
dialects
yep
and
east
asians
use
a
variety
of
scripts
as
well
i
am
not
claiming
it
has
to
be
purely
logical
i
am
claiming
that
seeing
it
mathematically
is
logical
and
natural
to
me
in
my
dialect
ill
have
to
think
about
this
one
thanks
here
youve
got
a
nice
overview
over
the
etymology
og
beer
and
some
info
on
cerveza
a
light
dublin
accent
can
actually
sound
quite
similar
to
some
accents
from
around
boston
bostoner
here
who
knows
irishmen
meh
the
boston
accent
has
more
influence
of
the
norfolk
accent
in
england
i
believe
boston
has
a
broad
a
so
words
like
bath
are
baahth
though
that
is
changing
quickly
and
it
is
rdropping
but
irish
accents
use
short
a
and
retain
r
the
reason
for
the
similarity
i
think
is
that
to
my
ear
a
dublin
accent
has
english
influence
indeed
it
is
sorry
my
portuguese
is
terrible
ive
fixed
it
ive
heard
very
little
of
it
to
me
it
sounds
indoeuropean
but
difficult
to
place
like
you
point
out
with
simlish
it
sounds
familiar
but
like
a
mix
if
i
remember
what
ive
heard
correctly
the
d
to
the
to
the
among
other
elements
give
it
a
range
of
features
that
you
find
in
languages
that
are
otherwise
geographically
far
apart
i
use
hebrew
with
my
wife
to
discuss
things
we
do
not
want
others
to
know
things
like
leaving
a
tip
at
a
restaurant
when
to
ditch
a
party
etc
first
id
look
at
the
state
of
the
language
can
it
still
be
saved
many
languages
that
are
listed
as
dying
in
reference
texts
have
been
beyond
saving
for
decades
once
you
have
no
more
native
speakers
in
the
reproductive
age
its
over
if
you
are
a
native
speaker
yourself
have
children
be
sure
to
use
the
language
around
your
children
as
much
as
possible
if
you
are
not
a
speaker
all
you
can
do
to
help
is
increase
the
prestige
and
usefulness
of
the
language
for
native
speakers
languages
usually
die
when
they
either
lose
prestige
ie
the
language
gets
regarded
as
the
language
of
low
social
classes
or
the
speakers
are
fragmented
they
live
far
apart
and
so
they
can
never
talk
to
each
other
in
any
case
activities
have
to
focus
on
children
since
they
are
the
ones
who
are
most
likely
to
switch
to
a
new
language
and
forget
the
old
one
things
to
do
set
up
a
preschool
exclusively
for
children
who
speak
the
language
set
up
afterschool
activities
in
the
language
produce
music
audio
books
stage
plays
short
films
in
the
language
start
a
radio
station
in
the
language
id
be
reluctant
to
do
much
that
focuses
on
written
language
books
and
wikipedia
entries
and
such
are
good
for
preserving
the
language
as
an
artifact
for
future
generations
of
scholars
to
study
but
they
are
not
much
help
in
keeping
the
language
alive
people
care
about
what
they
speak
not
about
what
they
read
norman
words
of
norse
origin
influence
of
old
frankish
on
french
list
of
french
words
of
germanic
origin
should
get
you
started
germanic
has
a
huge
presence
in
french
vocabulary
to
the
extent
where
simple
words
that
have
cognates
in
other
romance
languages
do
not
in
french
eg
fr
choisir
to
choose
sp
elegir
it
scegliere
even
the
productive
suffix
esque
comes
from
germanic
cognate
with
english
ish
more
comes
from
the
language
of
the
franks
and
conquered
germanic
tribes
than
directly
from
norse
dont
you
mean
schwag
in
that
case
one
of
the
practice
problems
is
on
our
takehome
final
luckily
i
have
2
weeks
to
work
at
it
i
am
indeed
from
rmontrealrmontreal
if
youre
willing
to
lend
it
out
i
would
definitely
be
interested
i
registered
for
advanced
phonology
with
the
same
prof
but
only
after
confirming
that
she
wont
be
using
kk
for
the
textbook
in
that
class
i
really
want
to
get
my
basics
down
because
even
with
the
hellish
textbook
i
really
enjoy
phonology
currently
google
is
often
used
as
a
verb
for
performing
an
internet
search
trolling
fooooo
as
a
malapropism
for
fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
i
have
witnessed
someone
use
google
to
mean
merely
a
search
as
in
ill
just
google
them
on
facebook
trolling
and
pranking
do
have
some
similarities
specifically
the
goal
of
creating
a
strong
reaction
from
someone
unless
youre
tending
toward
the
older
definition
of
trolling
which
is
more
akin
to
identifying
those
who
are
new
based
on
their
reactions
to
often
discussed
topics
which
would
seem
less
applicable
in
real
life
ppshrug
i
kinda
wish
you
would
have
provided
your
working
definition
of
trolling
ive
never
heard
either
of
these
on
the
east
coast
huh
it
is
currently
happening
in
norway
there
should
be
a
lot
of
material
about
it
skarrer
is
norwegian
for
uvular
r
ruller
is
alveolartrilled
phonetic
border
apparently
starts
between
risr
and
tvedestrand
in
norway
and
one
theory
says
that
it
is
spreading
to
areas
that
dont
possess
retroflex
ntd
now
i
want
a
program
to
generate
counterfeit
english
words
like
telk
i
cant
think
of
a
language
without
the
distinction
between
man
and
woman
did
you
mean
a
language
with
only
genderneutral
pronouns
or
a
language
without
words
for
a
man
and
a
woman
the
latter
seems
a
bit
silly
anyway
wikipedia
mentions
many
languages
with
only
genderneutral
pronouns
in
the
article
genderneutral
pronoun
also
an
interesting
point
of
view
under
uralic
languages
thus
at
a
time
when
english
is
moving
towards
genderneutrality
finnish
is
moving
to
speciesneutrality
so
can
i
use
it
to
refer
to
a
single
person
of
unknown
gender
for
example
viktorbir
gave
me
a
really
helpful
tip
about
pronouns
i
have
to
say
thank
you
to
it
its
worth
pointing
out
though
that
apparently
the
alternate
characters
were
artificially
devised
due
to
the
influence
of
english
the
different
characters
for
ta
in
chinese
are
a
recent
addition
and
do
not
change
the
fact
that
chinese
has
a
single
genderneutral
pronoun
writing
is
a
secondary
overlay
on
the
spoken
language
which
is
primary
perhaps
it
is
not
gender
that
is
simple
but
you
i
guess
thats
how
you
write
japanese
has
longer
words
andor
sentence
constructions
in
more
than
2500
characters
course
the
nice
thing
about
english
is
that
you
can
shrink
the
words
by
using
spoking
instead
of
speaking
cool
that
the
big
problem
i
can
see
here
is
the
number
of
syllables
what
might
be
described
as
something
like
shtsharshts
one
syllable
in
a
language
like
polish
might
be
analyzed
as
shutsharshuts
three
syllables
and
shitisharushitsu
six
syllables
in
japanese
like
how
gilberts
became
kiribati
christmas
became
kiritimati
in
polynesian
or
how
christo
became
kirisuto
in
japanese
hispanic
linguistics
but
i
assume
youre
a
native
english
speaker
right
thank
you
for
your
answer
im
going
to
go
with
that
it
is
because
they
are
relatively
rare
in
usage
ive
studied
french
for
a
few
years
now
and
im
still
iffy
on
some
numbers
just
because
i
rarely
have
to
use
them
obviously
110
are
simple
enough
but
beyond
that
it
can
get
hairy
it
doesnt
help
that
french
uses
a
weird
counting
system
70
soixantedix
lit
sixtyten
and
90
quatrevingtdix
lit
fourtwentyten
it
is
also
pretty
easy
to
avoid
learning
numbers
because
they
are
almost
always
written
in
numerals
however
not
a
single
fuck
is
given
i
hope
that
isnt
a
representation
of
your
luck
with
the
women
the
silliest
comment
there
trying
to
show
the
simplicity
of
english
no
genders
simple
rules
on
past
tense
verbs
and
composite
words
to
name
a
few
try
learning
german
greek
chinese
etc
english
is
less
morphologically
complex
than
most
european
languages
but
chinese
chinese
has
no
gender
even
in
spoken
pronouns
it
has
no
past
tense
at
all
it
is
demonstrably
simpler
in
the
features
chosen
by
this
person
leading
me
to
believe
they
have
no
familiarity
with
chinese
and
linguistics
the
song
is
so
catchy
i
want
more
for
other
dialects
thanks
so
much
for
this
latenight
reply
this
subreddits
kept
me
entertained
all
night
exactly
please
keep
in
mind
that
learning
a
language
and
learning
the
correct
orthography
of
a
language
are
separate
issues
beotian
me
has
nothing
to
add
to
the
fascinating
conversation
but
im
enjoying
it
tremendously
davenport
potato
just
doesnt
have
the
same
ring
taxi
and
cab
i
know
they
split
from
the
same
word
decades
ago
and
im
not
sure
how
that
affects
their
synonymy
seems
to
work
though
i
suspect
thats
only
because
these
arent
words
that
are
in
common
use
i
also
suspect
that
among
other
chemists
to
take
your
example
the
terms
you
use
will
say
a
lot
about
your
background
and
your
credentials
and
are
therefore
possibly
not
as
semantically
similar
as
you
might
think
eg
theoretical
chemists
may
look
down
their
noses
at
industrial
chemists
and
the
terms
they
use
may
mark
them
as
such
talking
to
the
programs
you
were
rejected
from
is
a
good
idea
because
there
may
be
something
specific
that
you
can
do
in
order
to
improve
your
chances
but
dont
start
to
freak
out
because
you
have
one
rejection
notice
its
competitive
and
schools
arent
just
looking
for
the
best
students
but
also
the
best
fit
also
keep
in
mind
that
sometimes
rejections
are
the
first
to
go
out
it
could
be
you
heard
from
this
school
first
because
it
is
a
rejection
and
it
doesnt
mean
that
your
chances
at
the
others
are
bad
i
got
rejected
from
half
of
the
schools
i
applied
to
but
i
had
some
blemishes
on
my
record
due
to
poor
health
and
didnt
do
honors
i
shot
pretty
high
im
guessing
that
if
i
was
a
good
enough
to
student
to
get
into
some
of
those
schools
then
you
are
too
if
you
dont
get
in
then
its
probably
something
to
do
with
your
application
and
you
really
should
talk
to
the
programs
you
also
might
seek
advice
about
your
application
at
your
undergrad
institution
from
someone
whos
been
part
of
the
grad
admissions
decisions
ahh
we
hadnt
considered
the
similarity
to
it
thanks
for
the
answer
while
i
have
no
problem
with
this
piece
the
following
stuck
in
my
craw
recent
work
in
philosophy
psychology
and
artificial
intelligence
has
suggested
an
alternative
picture
that
rejects
the
idea
that
languages
are
stable
abstract
objects
that
we
learn
and
then
use
yeah
those
are
the
fields
which
can
tell
you
about
language
change
not
like
linguistics
would
have
anything
to
say
we
dont
get
no
respect
just
a
quick
question
are
you
actually
a
native
trilingual
ie
you
speak
all
three
languages
natively
since
birth
id
believe
you
if
you
said
yes
quite
extraordinary
though
but
if
not
id
suggest
just
speaking
your
native
languages
to
your
son
otherwise
you
may
run
the
risk
of
imparting
weird
grammar
or
pronunciation
to
him
unless
of
course
hes
getting
input
from
other
people
too
thats
a
nice
program
i
wish
we
had
that
here
maybe
now
that
we
have
a
neuroscience
department
they
might
start
throwing
a
few
students
our
way
i
would
read
some
more
casual
or
pop
linguistics
books
to
really
cement
your
interest
in
linguistics
before
any
of
the
more
heady
pieces
of
literature
scare
you
off
as
a
side
note
id
learn
the
english
ipa
international
phonetic
alphabet
chart
before
you
pursue
further
literature
not
knowing
would
be
like
performing
math
calculations
without
knowing
what
any
of
the
operator
signs
were
as
a
high
schooler
this
is
your
time
to
read
god
knows
you
wont
have
as
much
time
to
do
it
in
college
only
after
you
get
a
general
feel
for
what
linguists
actually
do
and
study
would
i
recommend
making
a
choice
its
certainly
not
for
everyone
great
story
demonstrating
just
how
different
certain
languages
can
be
you
want
a
great
pop
introduction
thatll
really
help
you
tap
your
toe
on
the
vast
ocean
surface
known
as
linguistics
id
give
this
a
try
too
you
like
what
you
read
and
think
it
would
be
admirable
to
contribute
to
the
swiftly
growing
pool
of
knowledge
we
currently
have
in
this
wonderful
field
then
pursue
more
academically
oriented
sources
and
as
others
said
maybe
narrow
your
interests
further
by
contacting
a
certain
professor
or
researcher
hope
this
helped
ouch
i
love
james
joyce
they
have
the
running
boy
is
here
isnt
a
very
good
example
its
not
even
acting
as
a
verb
youre
the
csci
guy
from
upenn
if
you
need
it
for
class
work
you
can
try
talking
to
the
linguistics
department
theyre
very
friendly
and
might
be
able
to
legally
help
does
the
level
of
intelligibility
between
them
more
or
less
correlate
with
geographic
distance

nepali
is
very
close
iiuc
i
can
understand
basic
punjabi
and
bengali
with
some
straining
which
gets
better
with
time
and
even
better
if
you
spend
some
time
examining
the
differences
gujrati
and
marathi
sound
alien
to
me
except
for
a
few
words
here
and
there
but
ive
never
really
tried
to
understand
these
i
tend
to
think
of
languages
within
a
family
as
pretty
close
but
do
note
that
im
more
linguisticsminded
than
my
peers
so
i
might
be
better
at
this
than
them
ive
learnt
some
german
and
from
that
i
can
understand
some
dutch
and
swedish
but
some
of
my
german
friends
think
im
lying
because
these
two
languages
sound
completely
alien
to
them
mostly
im
curious
to
know
how
much
effort
would
be
required
to
understand
and
speak
one
of
the
other
indoaryan
languages
after
gaining
a
foothold
in
hindiurdu
if
youre
a
smart
person
with
a
flexible
ear
you
should
be
able
to
gain
some
ability
in
other
languages
i
feel
lucky
to
have
started
out
with
hindiurdu
and
english
both
mongrel
languages
hindiurdu
gave
me
an
insight
into
sanskrit
and
other
indian
languages
persian
and
arabic
while
english
gave
me
insight
into
germanic
and
latin
based
languages
its
a
great
base
for
learning
new
languages
lojban
does
something
similar
its
grices
maxims
including
the
socalled
fifth
maxim
be
polite
another
example
oh
youre
a
linguist
how
many
languages
do
you
speak
two
because
getting
into
the
whole
explanation
of
what
a
linguist
is
isnt
worth
it
with
most
people
blocking
effect
the
form
hardly
has
taken
on
a
different
meaning
thus
hard
has
no
place
to
go
when
it
wants
to
become
an
adverb
poor
hard
i
would
venture
that
its
because
they
dont
make
any
testable
assertions
never
obey
gravity
might
be
absurd
and
impossible
but
its
not
saying
anything
about
gravity
or
a
persons
relationship
to
it
you
might
argue
that
theres
an
implication
that
the
person
giving
the
command
believes
it
to
be
possible
and
that
assertion
of
possibility
is
carried
in
the
statement
but
that
seems
to
link
the
meaning
of
a
statement
to
the
speaker
in
such
an
inherent
fashion
as
to
make
communication
rather
difficult
if
i
can
alter
the
meaning
of
any
of
my
statements
ex
post
facto
by
claiming
povs
that
only
i
can
have
knowledge
of
ive
essentially
unilaterally
usurped
the
right
to
define
all
terms
and
conditions
in
all
conversations
people
like
that
are
very
difficult
to
have
a
productive
conversation
with
because
theyve
already
claimed
their
perception
of
reality
as
the
only
correct
one
anyway
ianal
but
the
idea
of
imperatives
being
falsifiable
seems
to
require
a
very
specific
set
of
conditions
around
meaning
that
could
be
extremely
problematic
i
think
you
are
one
of
my
favourite
commenters
here
on
rlinguistics
mostly
because
of
comments
like
this
and
being
a
amazing
source
of
information
these
are
imperative
statements
and
thus
i
would
argue
are
not
falsifiable
this
response
is
disingenuous
because
there
is
a
straightforward
way
to
judge
an
imperative
statement
what
are
the
reasons
to
actually
fulfill
the
request
it
makes
the
problem
with
the
proscriptivist
dilettantes
is
a
combination
of
various
things
1
unjustified
value
statements
sentences
that
use
such
and
such
construction
sound
clumsy
2
factual
statements
about
grammar
that
are
not
just
false
but
crazy
eg
janes
mother
is
angry
with
her
is
ungrammatical
because
possessives
are
adjectives
and
thus
jane
cannot
be
an
antecedent
for
her
3
they
routinely
fail
to
follow
their
own
rules
4
loads
of
class
and
racial
prejudice
and
many
many
other
reasons
since
the
replies
you
got
arent
terribly
helpful
the
q
you
see
in
pinyin
is
a
completely
unrelated
sound
ipa
t
the
emergence
of
pinyin
was
used
to
aid
in
teaching
chinese
by
having
an
easy
to
read
latin
script
the
u
sound
that
follows
pinyin
q
j
and
x
is
also
unrelated
as
im
typing
this
i
just
saw
lingprofs
comment
that
explains
it
in
formal
terms
read
that
for
a
detailed
explanation
i
think
by
the
time
where
people
actually
get
some
kind
of
degree
in
linguistics
the
so
called
ship
has
already
sailed
i
really
cannot
imagine
how
hard
it
must
be
to
learn
another
language
when
you
are
2530
years
old
i
myself
got
lucky
when
i
was
smaller
that
i
got
dragged
into
different
countries
for
just
the
right
amount
of
time
in
order
to
be
able
to
learn
the
countries
languages
i
suspect
a
lot
of
the
languages
you
may
be
thinking
of
get
it
from
latinwikipedia
seems
to
think
thats
how
european
languages
get
that
distinction
however
lots
of
languages
show
formality
in
different
ways
i
always
felt
that
ending
a
sentence
with
with
or
of
was
generally
a
bit
ugly
and
ungainly
even
when
i
was
a
little
kid
writing
stories
i
tried
not
to
do
it
i
was
only
a
few
years
later
that
i
learned
the
rule
that
confirmed
my
choice
personally
from
a
creative
writing
perspective
i
think
its
a
good
general
piece
of
advice
i
understand
but
people
did
not
kick
the
bucket
in
the
same
way
people
actually
turned
up
the
music
im
not
a
linguist
but
let
me
try
to
shed
some
light
when
a
nonlinguist
ordinary
person
refers
to
poor
english
he
could
be
referring
to
a
number
of
different
phenomena
1
an
english
dialect
that
has
different
rules
from
the
prestige
dialect
of
the
particular
area
yo
dog
what
up
yall
aint
never
gonna
go
down
that
there
store
and
so
on
2
common
usage
within
a
prestige
dialect
that
differs
from
the
formally
taught
rules
of
the
dialect
shes
the
one
who
i
danced
with
3
usage
that
is
both
formally
and
colloquially
correct
but
violates
some
overzealously
applied
rule
see
also
this
thread
4
utterances
that
actually
break
the
common
rules
of
the
english
language
but
still
may
be
moreorless
understandable
as
morton
going
for
the
store
of
which
to
buying
an
dictionaries
as
far
as
i
know
this
wouldnt
be
acceptable
in
any
dialect
of
english
5
errors
in
writing
its
spring
so
she
went
their
too
give
the
company
its
annual
seminar
you
go
to
your
5
friendly
neighborhood
linguists
and
complain
to
each
about
the
proliferation
of
poor
english
1

and
3
go
on
a
rant
about
prescriptivism
versus
descriptivism
4
and
5
nod
and
agree
with
you
why
linguistics
is
the
scientific
study
of
language
as
such
a
linguists
job
is
to
observe
language
in
use
describe
how
language
works
and
perhaps
generalize
some
rules
that
are
common
to
some
or
all
languages
linguistics
as
a
science
describes
how
language
and
languages
work
based
on
observation
and
experimentation
it
takes
no
stance
on
how
language
or
languages
ought
to
work
lets
take
a
look
at
another
science
biology
its
accepted
in
biology
that
the
theory
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
is
the
best
way
to
describe
according
to
the
evidence
how
life
transitioned
from
the
first
organisms
to
the
wide
variety
of
life
around
today
if
you
walk
into
a
biology
conference
and
insist
that
according
to
your
religion
life
was
created
6000
years
ago
by
a
divine
creator
and
exists
today
in
exactly
the
same
form
as
it
was
created
youll
be
gently
laughed
at
this
is
because
regardless
of
personal
beliefs
on
the
origin
of
species
biology
as
a
science
observes
living
organisms
describes
how
these
living
organisms
function
and
generalizes
rules
for
how
some
or
all
living
organisms
operate
coming
into
rlinguistics
and
complaining
about
descriptivism
is
parallel
to
going
into
rbiology
and
talking
about
creationism
just
as
your
particular
holy
book
is
not
considered
an
acceptable
way
to
derive
scientific
theory
in
biology
your
particular
beliefs
on
how
language
ought
to
behave
are
not
considered
an
acceptable
way
to
derive
scientific
theory
in
linguistics
but
you
ask
why
did
linguists
4
and
5
agree
with
me
example
4
would
not
convey
a
meaning
from
speaker
to
audience
according
to
the
rules
of
any
known
english
dialect
it
is
indisputably
poor
english
however
if
we
did
come
to
discover
a
dialect
where
4
is
acceptable
we
would
dutifully
observe
and
describe
it
example
5
deals
with
the
rules

the
most
part

i
think
fifteenlettered
and
considered
are
both
interesting
examples
albeit
for
different
reasons
heres
a
list
some
entries
are
pretty
poor
though
miktex
is
the
standard
package
if
youre
on
windows
if
youre
on
mac
os
x
you
want
mactex
and
the
editor
youll
probably
want
to
use
is
texshop
which
is
included
in
the
mactex
package
if
youre
on
linux
with
a
standard
fullfeatured
distribution
you
probably
already
have
latex
open
a
terminal
and
see
if
latex
is
in
your
path
in
that
case
all
you
might
want
to
install
is
an
editor
honestly
if
youve
never
used
latex
and
you
need
to
start
using
it
right
away
for
work
youre
doing
right
now
youre
going
to
struggle
its
better
to
take
the
time
to
learn
latex
decently
before
you
need
to
use
it
expect
to
spend
lots
of
time
trying
to
get
simple
things
in
your
documents
to
work
when
youre
just
starting
out
simple
documents
and
mathematical
formulas
you
can
quickly
learn
to
do
fairly
easily
but
the
stuff
youre
talking
about
isnt
as
simple
and
the
documentation
for
the
linguisticsoriented
latex
packages
typically
assumes
general
latex
knowledge
i
have
always
associated
scream
with
fear
for
instance
at
apprehension
of
danger
or
when
startled
usually
with
a
negative
connotation
and
usually
at
a
high
pitch
ie
a
piercing
sound
at
a
high
frequency
as
opposed
to
grunt
or
growl
which
are
typically
low
pitch
sounds
shout
and
yell
to
me
describe
speaking
at
a
high
volume
for
either
positive
or
negative
reasons
if
you
consider
all
those
stops
mint
condition
batman
etc
to
be
simply
unreleased
stops
and
not
glottal
stops
then
youre
right
that
theres
a
conflict
and
if
he
changed
it
to
say
that
theyre
unreleased
instead
of
glottal
then
of
course
the
joke
about
cockney
no
longer
works
but
as
i
mention
in
my
other
comment
those
examples
could
be
argued
to
have
a
glottal
stop
unreleased
stop
back
to
back
and
perceptually
theres
really
no
difference
between
the
combinations
so
its
still
ok
the
bigger
problem
is
panel
1
american
english
glottal
which
he
wrote
as
gloddle
involves
no
glottal
stop
whatsoever
nor
even
an
unreleased
stop
the
t
here
is
actually
a
flap
followed
by
a
syllabic
l
gll
even
if
you
do
find
a
way
to
get
rid
of
swear
words
and
racist
slang
it
wouldnt
make
a
difference
even
if
everyone
was
on
board
with
it
sooner
or
later
new
swears
and
racist
slang
will
crop
up
in
my
view
as
long
as
there
is
an
unequal
power
structure
there
will
be
words
to
used
to
discriminate
against
those
with
less
power
which
encompasses
racist
words
and
through
semantic
shift
maybe
words
will
come
to
have
taboo
meanings
and
thus
become
new
swear
words
just
my
2
cents
lets
make
sweet
sweet
discworld
love
generally
in
a
situation
of
aggravation
or
surprise
frequently
but
not
necessarily
negative
maybe
where
an
american
might
use

or
holy

etc
hearing

shocking

jam
that
type
of
thing
as
somebody
who
speaks
decent
french
that
creole

is
like
lolcats
spelling
i
had
to
say
it
out
loud
to
get
al
and
to
oh
the
actual
tool
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
how
in
some
nonstandard
varieties
of
modern
english
and
going
back
all
the
way
to
old
english
some
people
axe
questions
rather
than
ask
questions
in
the
case
of
the
tool
its
just
a
consonant
cluster
as
others
have
mentioned
affricates
must
be
homorganicthat
is
both
parts
of
them
must
occur
at
the
same
place
of
articulation
so
kx
is
a
possible
affricate
but
px
is
not
now
it
could
be
a
valid
consonant
cluster
as
others
havent
mentioned
japanese
does
not
allow
consonant
clusters
though
some
people
analyze
it
as
having
cy
clusters
like
py
ty
and
ky
but
i
really
think
those
are
just
palatalized
consonants
this
is
why
this
seems
like
a
big
deal
because
ks
just
cannot
be
a
thing
under
the
normal
rules
of
japanese
of
course
the
related
miyako
language
has
such
words
as
ksks
to
come

p
of
course
but
the
northern
cities
shift
is
also
a
good
example
because
its
more
recent
i
suppose
the
trapbath
split
is
another
fairly
recent
example
there
have
been
some
consonant
shifts
such
as
the
changes
in
dental
consonants
between
english
and
other
germanic
languages
and
the
modern
silence
of
gh
but
vowels
have
shifted
quite
a
bit
more
historically
credits
to
lolphonology
on
facebook
yes
im
discussing
the
definition
itself
the
etymology
and
its
connections
with
other
words
sharing
the
same
stem
thanks
i
think
part
of
the
problem
with
the
recent
posts
is
that
many
people
do
not
understand
what
linguistics
means
to
linguist
the
general
public
seems
to
equate
linguistics
with
someone
who
can
speak
many
languages
andor
the
study
of
grammar
which
is
understandable
for
someone
who
has
never
studied
linguistics
by
the
definition
of
professional
subreddit
can
i
assume
that
that
means
linguist
or
language
enthusiast
can
all
come
together
in
this
subreddit
and
talk
about
linguistics
if
that
is
the
case
cool
with
me
but
reddit
is
up
on
the
internet
anyone
can
access
this
subreddit
so
because
linguistics
generally
means
something
different
to
the
public
and
since
this
reddit
is
open
to
the
public
i
can
see
why
there
tend
to
be
post
that
seem
too
ancient
prescriptive
grammarian
arguments
so
if
i
were
a
nonlinguist
and
i
came
to
this
subreddit
with
my
supposed
linguistic
question
and
if
i
read
the
sidebar
im
either
still
going
to
post
whatever
question
i
have
or
i
am
going
to
be
steered
away
i
honestly
would
rather
have
questions
asked
that
have
been
asked
before
i
rather
have
seemingly
prescriptivist
arguments
appear
i
rather
attract
people
than
possibly
steer
because
if
people
are
asking
the
same
question
that
means
they
either
dont
understand
havent
searched
this
subreddit
for
the
question
already
or
are
trolling
but
still
they
have
a
question
they
want
answered
so
lets
try
to
answer
it
with
a
linguistic
twist
if
someone
post
prescriptive
articles
what
a
terrific
opportunity
to
educate
the
op
on
descriptivism
so
i
dont
know
if
i
have
suggested
anything
or
not
but
i
do
know
im
okay
with
wayside
post
it
isnt
what
is
posted
that
makes
this
community
it
is
how
we
respond
to
post
that
creates
it
and
im
all
for
educating
people
on
the
awesomeness
that
is
linguistics
and
as
a
subtle
side
note
when
looking
at
raskscience
and
ranswers
their
sidebars
explain
what
the
goals
are
of
the
subreddit
and
examples
on
what
is
an
appropriate
post
vs
an
inappropriate
one
rlinguistics
sidebar
doesnt
really
have
any
of
this
it
says
more
about
what
not
to
do
rather
what
can
be
done
and
vaguely
states
that
linguistic
questions
are
fine
what
makes
for
a
linguistic
question
so
maybe
we
can
make
the
sidebar
a
bit
more
optimistic
and
welcoming
make
it
into
a
guide
rather
than
a
warning
and
what
purpose
do
you
think
posts
that
contain
nothing
but
examples
of
poor
language
serve
ill
pm
you

forced

them
tend
to
develop

thats
takes
negative
words
from
the
dominant
language
and
repurpose
them
is
this
an
anecdotal
observation
or
do
you
have
a
source
if
the
latter
please
cite
it
as
id
like
to
read
more
about
this
i
was
thinking
the
same
thing
while
i
was
working
on
it
ill
bet
by
the
time
i
post
someone
will
already
have
it
done
3
yeah
i
nearly
forgot
when
i
was
about
to
save
as
a
transparent
png
nikogonet
criticized
the
anecdote
as
not
being
sufficient
to
prove
etymology
the
anecdote
is
not
however
necessary
to
prove
the
etymology
since
the
etymology
is
proven
in
other
ways
in
the
article
nowhere
does
the
article
actually
suggest
that
the
anecdote
brought
up
is
evidence
of
etymology
never
heard
anyone
say
that
you
would
almost
always
put
in
an
adverb
eg
or
the
ul
on
your
username
looks
romanian
the
definite
article
right
but
the
rest
of
it
looks
slavic
is
it
were
not
even
sure
that
all
languages
descend
from
a
single
source
wouldnt
this
be
based
on
the
assumption
that
only
homo
sapiens
had
language
we
know
that
various
hominid
species
coexisted
or
at
least
lived
in
approximately
the
same
areas
for
a
very
long
time
not
necessarily
obviously
we
have
no
evidence
of
other
hominids
such
s
neanderthals
having
language
we
dont
even
know
if
humans
had
language
at
any
given
point
in
prehistory
but
the
question
of
whether
human
language
descended
from
a
single
source
would
not
to
me
relate
to
whether
any
other
hominids
had
language
as
i
understand
it
humans
can
look
at
a
group
up
to
7
and
know
how
many
are
in
the
group
they
can
also
identify
an
individual
say
the
4th
in
the
sequence
over
7
they
need
to
count
for
total
number
and
for
placement
in
the
group
some
can
go
higher
kind
of
important
for
phone
numbers
and
why
typing
long
numerical
addresses
is
so
difficult
you
are
correct
that
i
did
misunderstand
you
slightly
somehow
i
managed
to
read
your
post
without
actually
absorbing
any
of
it
whoops
just
tramping
around
in
london
lost
my
creditdebit
card
on
the
tube
actually
you
make
2
points
1
the
blog
post
wasnt
well
written
in
your
opinion
and
2
the
post
want
really
great
smirk
because
of
it
if
you
felt
that
the
points
in
the
post
were
valid
but
that
the
style
was
bad
and
that
its
unfortunate
that
the
author
obviously
thought
those
reading
the
blog
post
would
already
be
aware
of
the
back
story
because
it
makes
it
difficult
for
those
who
dont
then
you
should
probably
have
said
that
but
thats
not
what
you
said
is
it
ps
pot
kettle
are
you
asking
me
to
say
this
prayer
in
my
language
i
can
try

now
i
know
i
need
to
come
up
with
a
word
for
heaven
forgive
and
leadguide
i
can
do
without
the
others
this
is
how
i
become
fluent
indeed
written
language
at
least
formal
written
language
is
the
proper
place
for
prescriptivist
rules
once
people
try
to
apply
them
to
the
way
people
speak
the
misunderstandings
begin
occurring
lolspeak
srsly
writing
is
not
really
a
part
of
language
it
is
an
artificial
overlay
on
language
and
must
be
learned
in
school
and
is
only
used
by
a
minority
of
the
worlds
population
what
happens
in
writing
has
little
if
any
effect
on
language
but
france
is
an
english
word
along
with
mexico
and
argentina
we
might
spell
those
the
same
as
the
countries
but
we
dont
pronounce
them
the
same
as
the
inhabitants
i
expect
a
lot
better
out
of
this
subreddit
than
posts
like
why
would
a
language
want
to
change
its
alphabet
script
or
why
are
there
so
many
languages
perhaps
the
most
basic
questions
eg
are
languages
being
born
right
now
could
be
deleted
have
you
read
the
discussions
which
developed
from
those
posts
they
all
turned
into
excellent
discussions
from
seemingly
simple
questions
i
was
just
thinking
yesterday
how
much
i
enjoyed
interacting
with
intelligent
newcomers
who
wanted
to
learn
about
linguistics
if
what
youre
looking
for
is
highend
discussions
you
might
sign
up
for
some
of
the
listserves
on
linguist
list
i
do
those
too
and
i
get
a
lot
out
of
them
but
not
as
much
as
i
get
out
of
rlinguistics
its
got
laxing
in
closed
syllablesmaybe
thats
whats
meant
by
clipped
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
pronounce
it
as
fa
kju
it
is
ironic
that
the
oldest
known
document
in
any
finnic
language
was
written
in
cyrillic
birch
bar
letter
in
oldkarelian
xiii
century
thats
how
all
languages
have
all
tenses
aspects
and
moods
theyre
just
not
all
expressed
the
same
way
as
for
going
to
aka
gonna
youre
right
i
knew
i
was
gonna
get
caught
making
such
a
categorical
statement
but
i
couldnt
think
of
anything
else
at
the
time
but
in
that
case
theres
more
going
on
there
in
your
example
the
tense
is
actually
present
its
the
aspect
or
mood
or
something
else
that
is
in
fact
being
represented
by
gonna
it
is
more
of
an
inevitability
which
is
different
from
future

hey
wait
a
minute
i
grew
up
in
the

period
does
this
mean
we
had
no

my
pleasure
ive
always
had
a
deep
interest
in
dravidian
languages
although
i
can
only
speak
tamil
poorly
and
read
it
a
little
better
than
that
ive
been
to
tamil
nadu
and
have
always
wanted
to
visit
kerala
just
for
fun
did
you
know
that
malayalam
is
the
longest
language
name
which
is
also
a
palindrome
as
much
as
i
dislike
agreeing
with
someone
in
rchristianity
its
pretty
accurate
except
the
date
for
the
norman
invasion
was
1066
in
se
wouldnt
one
just
use
he
is
working
for
the
former
and
he
works
for
the
latter
im
not
a
linguist
myself
but
i
did
one
module
in
it
while
at
university
and
i
seem
to
remember
there
was
a
whole
school
of
thought
that
language
evolved
primarily
for
interpersonal
not
ideational
reasons
wouldnt
this
be
similar
to
what
you
are
suggesting
i
also
remember
reading
something
about
how
humour
is
used
to
identify
insider
outsider
status
this
might
add
some
weight
to
your
theory
as
well
as
i
say
i
might
be
miles
off
as
im
by
no
means
an
expert
in
this
area
as
you
can
probably
tell
most
arabic
dialects
insert
epenthetic
linking
vowels
in
places
where
3
or
more
consonants
are
clustered
together

where

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
level
of
common
sense
that
ratheism
had
in
this
regard
latin
script
which
is
what
english
uses
not
latin
language
this
particular
refers
to
cyrillic
yo
not
latins
ediaeresis
yo
is
considered
a
separate
letter
whereas
latins
is
just
a
letter
e
with
a
diacritic
before
the
relatively
recent
rise
of
nationalism
and
the
general
concept
that
everyone
living
in
a
given
country
ought
to
share
markers
of
identity
like
a
common
language
it
was
much
more
common
to
see
mixing
like
this
in
europe
one
big
example
is
that
germanspeaking
people
however
you
want
to
define
german
had
communities
all
over
the
damn
place
throughout
eastern
europe
but
were
expelled
en
masse
following
ww2
edit
heres
a
map
im
not
talking
about
nazis
who
temporarily
moved
east
for
a
few
years
i
mean
germans
again
however
you
want
to
define
that
who
had
families
and
roots
laid
down
for
generations
in
areas
like
poland
and
lithuania
often
predating
the
existence
of
the
modern
state
of
germany
not
something
one
normally
hears
about
and
there
are
plenty
of
other
examples
like
this
language
change
is
basically
controlled
by
the
wereabunchoflazybastards
principle
combined
with
the
westillwanttounderstandeachother
principle
and
the
letsimitatetherich
principle
features
prominently
as
well
you
arent
going
to
end
up
with
a
lot
of
changes
that
make
the
meaning
overly
difficult
to
understand
due
to
the
wswtueo
principle
maybe
a
bit
of
ambiguity
can
be
introduced
sometimes
eg
two
words
were
previously
pronounced
differently
but
are
now
the
samecontext
usually
clarifies
which
is
which
but
nothing
to
the
extent
that
we
dont
know
what
the
other
lazy
bastard
is
talking
about
in
the
event
that
maybe
there
could
be
some
confusion
the
wswtueo
principle
could
motivate
a
new
change
i
cant
think
of
any
examples
in
english
but
this
resulted
in
the
following
change
in
korean
your
sounded
the
same
as
my
in
some
dialects
because
of
a
previous
change
both
becoming
more
or
less
ne
so
the
former
changed
to
become
ni
a
lot
of
or
maybe
even
most
changes
are
going
to
be
simultaneously
good
and
bad
according
to
your
criteria
eg
lets
say
a
language
develops
subject
dropping
in
the
style
of
koreanjapanesechinese
ie
no
person
agreement
on
the
verbmore
efficient
less
clear
obviously
doesnt
violate
the
wswtueo
principle
though
otherwise
speakers
wouldnt
do
it
i
feel
like
that
all
the
time
native
montrealers
pronouncing
an
initial
h
in
hejt
h
i
think
they
do
it
in
words
spelled
with
a
silent
h
too
as
a
form
of
hypercorrection
i
have
some
minor
lexicalpronunciation
differences
i
changed
my
pronunciation
of
route
from
rat
to
rut
when
i
was
a
kid
because
i
thought
my
pronunciation
of
it
was
uglier
still
pronounce
router
the
same
way
though
i
use
some
british
terminology
without
thinking
and
genuinely
without
any
conscious
intention
of
sounding
cultured
or
european
mostly
the
word
bloody
and
soccer
terminology
a
few
franglish
terms
manage
to
pop
up
from
time
to
time
can
you
give
me
the
coordinates
of
the
store
not
really
a
difference
from
my
local
dialect
but
i
have
noticed
that
my
accent
seems
to
have
gotten
more
exaggerated
since
moving
away
from
my
hometown
i
wasnt
aware
that
song
of
the
south
was
based
on
gullah
culture
i
have
heard
that
disneys
nonrelease
of
the
film
was
due
to
racial
stereotypes
perpetuated
in
he
film
though
not
having
seen
it
i
really
dont
know
for
a
movie
that
does
give
a
glimpse
of
gullah
language
and
culture
there
is
the
70s
film
conrack
well
done
i
cringe
to
think
of
the
response
youll
get
though
everyone
thinks
they
are
an
expert
on
language
your
link
doesnt
appear
to
be
working
im
at
the
point
with
german
to
where
while
my
vocabulary
is
comparatively
limited
i
know
the
syntax
and
basic
words
well
enough
to
where
i
can
essentially
think
in
german
i
might
not
have
a
particularly
specific
word
here
or
there
but
german
comes
very
naturally
for
me
now
what
helped
for
me
was
having
a
friend
and
coworker
with
whom
i
could
speak
the
language
often
i
had
a
friend
in
my
earlier
college
years
who
had
lived
in
germany
on
a
study
abroad
program
for
a
year
and
spoke
fluent
german
we
would
speak
in
german
a
lot
so
i
became
very
conversationally
fluent
it
probably
wouldnt
be
too
hard
to
make
weve
got
wenedyk
and
brythenig
and
half
a
dozen
other
languages
where
people
superimposed
nonromance
sound
changes
onto
a
bunch
of
latin
stems
ill
give
you
that
tones
are
difficult
for
nonnative
speakers
but
as
for
the
consonants
i
dont
know
theyre
just
alveolar
palatals
the
main
difficulty
there
isnt
the
consonants
place
of
articulation
but
the
manner
mandarin
as
you
probably
know
has
an
aspiration
contrast
as
opposed
to
a
voicing
contrast
thank
you
this
article
and
what
youre
saying
supports
the
above
quoted
statement
right
higher
cognitive
competence
than
monolinguals
is
a
benefitisnt
it
thats
a
classic
bit
but
there
is
no
example
of
hypercorrection
there
edit
typo
it
sounds
like
you
probably
have
ankyloglossia
which
means
the
connective
tissue
on
the
bottom
of
your
tongue
is
too
short
and
therefore
you
cant
get
your
tongue
to
flap
properly

r
you
were
referring
to
above
as
well
according
to
this
page
the
term
attercop
survives
in
yorkshire
dialect
in
addition
it
was
a
term
employed
by
tolkien
in
his
works
as
in
this
snippet
from
the
hobbit
old
fat
spider
spinning
in
a
tree
old
fat
spider
cant
see
me
attercop
attercop
wont
you
stop
stop
your
spinning
and
look
for
me
im
pretty
sure
thats
what
happened
to
the
words
laughter
tough
and
rough
we
just
kept
the
f
sound
for
some
reason
there
may
be
more
but
those
are
the
only
ones
that
came
to
mind
i
thought
it
was
a
new
idiom
and
loose
my
shit
meant
gave
me
diarrhea
the
functional
morphemes
required
in
any
japanese
utterance
plus
the
different
word
order
might
make
it
difficult
and
a
navy
the
cognate
youre
looking
for
here
is
fleet
also
this
is
a
writing
system
invented
for
a
constructed
language
but
tolkiens
tengwar
system
is
highly
adaptable
and
can
totally
be
used
to
write
english
this
is
true
i
taught
myself
how
to
write
english
in
tengwar
so
i
can
write
difficulttoread
notes
it
was
very
easy
to
do
me
pull
pl
edit
or
probably
even
pl
or
pl
in
fast
speech
rlinguistics
could
design
it
collaboratively
this
could
actually
work
i
was
thinking
this
same
thing
when
i
read
that
blog
that
front
paged
a
few
months
ago
something
like
ghetto
nature
walks
or
whatever
it
was
basically
making
fun
of
aave
by
quoting
kids
who
speak
it
but
something
stood
out
to
me
for
example
one
kid
mentions
that
he
wants
to
look
at
the
stars
but
he
says
microscope
instead
of
telescope
arguably
people
are
going
to
have
more
experienceneed
withfor
a
telescope
than
a
microscope
also
there
is
no
other
blahblahscope
out
there
to
be
confused
with
outside
of
more
technical
science
or
medical
jargon
so
these
two
examples
are
similar
i
dont
think
most
normal
people
think
of
astrology
as
an
accurate
science
or
even
a
hobby
the
only
surviving
part
of
it
in
modern
day
culture
is
the
use
of
horoscopes
so
theres
no
need
to
talk
about
astrology
as
it
is
classically
defined
its
not
in
use
by
the
society
like
microscope
but
probably
moreso
and
so
it
merges
with
a
similar
and
vaguely
related
word
this
is
tricky
im
excited
to
hear
from
some
historical
linguist
or
something
on
this
topic
the
anthem
for
the
society
of
deaf
conlangers
should
be
auxlang
sign
you
used
gebrauch
as
an
example
so
following
the
pattern
does
it
mean
something
that
is
needed
or
like
the
english
essentials
the
cologne
dialect
pronounces
the

with
a
j
i
dont
know
but
ive
just
always
assumed
that
most
of
the
more
northern
german
dialects
did
as
well
its
not
quite
right
to
say
still
have
j
though
since
the
change
happened
from
g
j
i
recently
discovered
an
online
campus
concerning
almost
all
possible
branches
of
lingsuistics
the
narrator
is
very
informative
and
easy
to
understand
check
this
out
this

also
has
a
ton
of

as
far
as
i
can
tell
i
have
only
seen

so
far
and
i
am
also
very
new
to

then
my
second

seems
to
be
a

were
only
looking

it
seems
to
work
i
could
totally
see
that
happening
prinking
being
foppish
i
am
laughing
so
much
prinking
is
the
word
predrinking
condensed
it
refers
to
drinking
before
you
go
out
generally
so
as
to
save
money
as
shopbought
alcohol
is
incredibly
cheaper
than
that

i
read

this
quality
should
be
fine
thanks
a
ton
awesome
just
finished
adding
my
support
on
kickstarter
i
think
it
depends
on
how
much
you
were
exposed
to
it
and
also
as
hatcheck
points
out
above
your
preconceptions
as
to
whether
you
will
understand
it
and
your
willingness
to
actually
understand
it
the
punchline
is
snoo
snoo
which
is
a
wellknown
futurama
term
on
the
original
posting
you
see
that
some
people
dont
get
it
or
are
pretending
not
to
and
answer
snoos
or
snooze
they
must
have
been
pretty
angry
to
do
this
to
ukrainian
police
snog
obviously
this
may
be
slightly
different
than
what
i
am
really
pointing
at
though
headdesk
thats
what
ive
been
trying
to
tell
you
remember
this
when
i
originally
posted
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
language
convergence
is
a
type
of
language
contactinduced
change
whereby
languages
with
many
bilingual
speakers
mutually
borrow
morphological
and
syntactic
features
making
their
typology
more
similar
read
the
wikipedia
page
you
linked
me
to
it
describes
this
phenomenon
if
you
had
done
what
i
had
said
and
looked
up
what
morphological
syntactic
and
typological
meant
you
would
have
realised
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
you
were
talking
about
and
we
could
have
avoided
all
this
as
for
your
sushi
example
thats
not
really
linguistic
convergence
i
imagine
kappa
kaiten
has
just
become
an
injoke
amongst
your
friends
theres
nothing
interesting
happening
there
at
the
structural
level
its
much
like
my
friend
who
thought
aioli
sauce
was
alioli
sauce
and
now
thats
the
only
thing
we
ever
call
it
there
may
be
something
interesting
happening
in
terms
of
your
acquisition
of
japanese
as
to
why
you
made
that
mistake
but
i
dont
know
enough
about
the
situation
itself
japanese
or
second
language
acquisition
to
give
you
a
good
answer
this
is
the
englishest
way
to
do
it
definitely
english
full
reduplication
indicates
the
prototypical
example
of
a
thing
although
ive
got
to
say
i
like
the
sound
of
eigen
yeah
it
really
surprised
me
id
like
it
to
be
i
really
enjoy
it
im
really
bothered
by
case
adpositions
and
theta
roles
and
id
really
like
to
do
work
in
figuring
that
mess
out
but
to
be
honest
id
like
to
do
more
work
in
other
subfields
before
i
dedicate
myself
to
one
thing
theres
no
attested
case
of
such
a
thing
heres
a
nice
table
for
you
man
so
an
example
of
a
long
string
of
consonants
could
be
all
his
reading
texts
threw
him
off
his
game
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
by
longest
pronounced
string
if
it
doesnt
have
to
be
words
you
could
just
go
back
and
forth
between
consonants
without
pronouncing
a
vowel
for
as
long
as
you
could
my
question
about
the
consent
should
have
been
phrased
can
you
not
do
your
work
with
publicly
available
twitter
data
thereby
bypassing
several
steps
standing
internet
ovation
course

i
find
it
more
surprising
that
unisex
names
are
the
exception
they
seem
to
make
more
sense
to
me
also
i
saw
it
pointed
out
that
names
which
change
gender
almost
all
go
from
male
to
female
i
dont
know
if
its
true
but
there
seem
to
be
a
lot
of
examples
i
wonder
why
that
is
i
read
once
that
a
relatively
common
female
name
i
cant
remember
which
one
and
cant
find
any
info
on
google
was
previously
male
but
changed
gender
when
a
female
character
in
a
novel
had
that
name
because
her
parents
had
chosen
the
name
thinking
they
were
having
boy
same
here
it
was
amazing
how
one
or
two
syllables
told
you
so
much
its
just
like
that
in

too

hey
what
about
all
those
nonformal
linguists
the
bbcs
horizon
series
occasionally
dips
its
toe
into
linguistics
there
was
a
very
interesting
episode
back
in
1997
called
silent

new

which
explored
the
new
language
created
by
deaf
children
in
nicaragua
i
cant
find
the
actual
episode
anywhere
but
a
clip
of
the
same
story
from
pbss
evolution
series
is
on

here
there
was
also
a
more
recent
episode
in
2009
called

this

is
available
on

its
also
touched

in

is
actually
a
very
old
phrase
i
found
this
on

finder
it
appears
in
one
of
the
apocyrphal
books
of
the
bible
i
esdras
322
and
when
they
are
in
their

they
forget
their

both
to

and

had
similar

such
as

put

i

number

was
the
thing
i
wanted
to

the
fact
that
you
were
able

paste

indicates
that
by

you
understood
that

that

i
really

youre

both

i
mainly
think

are
super
hard

i
agree
it
is
a

i
remember
thats
what
i
was
told
about
southern

but
it
turned
out
to
be
false
i
dont

should

i
wont

im

i

going

a

the

im
staying

is
used

receiving

one

there
volunteered

to

who
want
to
live

for

thats
what
im
basically
going
to
do
for

just
get
to
know

i
know
it
sounds
weird
but
thats
what
i
travel
for
discovering
a

somehow
it
makes
sense
to
me
that
thats
what
i
should
do
i
guess
i
underestimated
how
hard
it
is
to
do
what
i
thought
i
could
do
but
in
my
defense
im
seriously
just
an
amateur
ill
stick
to
learning
the
language
and
see
what
happens
partly
native
language
partly
the
age
at
which
you
learned
the
language
partly
the
accent
of
your
teacher
i
knew
a
venezuelan
once
who
spoke
with
a
perfect
ulster
accenthe
learned
the
language
from
childhood
from
a
northern
irish
teacher
think
about
the
technology
that
allowed
the
british
to
colonize
the
world
the
compass
maps
ships
etc
the
liberation
of
writing
devices
from
the
feather
to
the
computer
keyboard
online
dictionaries
affect
on
vocabulary
or
just
the
ease
of
looking
a
word
up
youtube
is
probably
responsible
for
exposing
many
people
to
dialects
words
pronunciations
idiosyncrasies
and
a
plethora
of
other
things
that
many
people
would
never
have
been
exposed
to
otherwise
lots
of
nonnative
english
speakers
interact
with
technology
that
is
written
and
supported
in
english
also
many
nonnative
english
speakers
interact
in
online
communities
that
are
almost
entirely
in

dont
forget
about
grammar
nazis
online
please
be
gentle
this
can
also
be
considered
with
nonnative
english
speakers
learning
aspects
of
the

that
arent

up
in

word
silk
screening
technology
may
be
something
to
consider
you
want
to
get
real
whacky
with
it
think
about
musical
instruments
and
the
technology
behind
them
musical
instruments
facilitating
artistic
expression
paired
with
prose
lets
get
real
whacky
advances
is
technology
and
science
that
led
to
the
development
of
those
horrible
drugs
you
hear
about
like
lsd
you
cant
make
acid
banging
rocks
together
the
word
psychedelic
was
coined
in
hand
written
letters
sealed
and
delivered
by
airplane
or
maybe
ship
over
an
ocean
to
describe
its
deal
with
the
human
brain
when
a
word
is
invented
it
often
relies
upon
more
than
just
spoken
word
to
become
solidified
in
the
lexicon
various
technology
streamlines
the
process
electricity
radio
television
i
hope
somewhere
in
all
that
poorly
formatted
and
hastily
written
rambling
you
find
something
helpful
good
luck
oh
i
didnt
mean
to
say
the
primary
meaning
of
faggot
has
changed
yet
i
just
meant
that
some
people
are
already
using
it
in
a
more
general
sense
wikipedia
actually
briefly
mentions
the
general
use
of
the
word
but
theres
no
doubt
that
the
primary
meaning
is
still
something
along
the
lines
of
bad
gay
man
im
in
no
way
advocating
for
the
usage
of
the
word
as
a
general
insult
and
i
never
use
it
myself
nor
am
i
trying
to
defend
anyone
using
it
im
just
trying
to
look
at
this
from
a
linguists
perspective
and
observing
how
the
word
is
actually
used
btw
luis
ck
does
an
interesting
bit
nsfw
language
on
faggot
and
even
though
it
is
standup
i
think
theres
still
some
truth
to
it
and
yes
civil
discussions
are
nice
so
thank
you
perfect
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
so
in
the
example
of
caesar
at
least
it
appears
that
the
hebrew
and
aramaic
example
of
transliterating
european
k
into
semitic
q
influenced
arabic
to
do
the
same
same
here
boston
rlinguistics
party
anyone
p
im
curious
as
to
the
order
in
which
semitic
peoples
say
north
south
east
and
west
chinese
people
generally
say
east
south
west
north
which
led
to
a
great
deal
of
confusion
when
i
was
younger
ive
read
our
magnificent
bastard
tongue
losing
the
race
and
word
on
the
street
its
all
pretty
basic
entrylevel
stuff
easy
fun
whatever
if
youre
interested
in
any
of
these
subjects
with
the
aforementioned
caveat
in
mind
you
should
enjoy
his
books
thank
you
i
really
like
the
third
one
wow
i
believe
that
the
majority
of
articles
available
hrk
were
publishedwritten
to
be
published
only
in
croatian
journals
if
we
stopped
writing
about
croatian
in
croatian
and
switched
exclusively
to
english
what
would
happen
to
croatian
linguistic
terminology
it
would
die
out
pretty
soon
dont
you
think
to
you
it
might
make
more
sense
to
write
everything
in
english
to
me
it
makes
more
sense
to
try
to
preserve
domestic
scientific
terminology
along
with
using
and
accepting
the
foreign
whenif
there
are
no
suitable
equivalents
yes
i
read
somewhere
that
he
coined
the
word
lonely
which
seems
unlikely
to
me
it
is
interesting
that
his
is
the
first
written
instance
of
the
word
though
no
problem
pity
reddit
wont
let
me
edit
the
original
post
i
hope
you
enjoy
it
i
think
some
of
the
jokes
might
be
lost
on
a
nonaustralian
audience
but
it
is
a
great
read
i
am
very
curious
about
this
i
cant
really
just
google
that
type
of
question
no
sorry
its
not
open
source
at
the
moment
i
need
an
income
source
so
i
want
to
keep
it
proprietary
for
a
while
the
alpha
and
beta
will
be
free
because
it
provides
no
service
but
the
full
featured
release
will
most
likely
be
1
because
it
is
the
lowest
price
on
android
i
would
like
to
do
open
source
when
i
could
afford
it
though
not
necessarily
this
app
though
however
it
is
in
java
so
porting
to
the
web
is
super
easy
if
i
wanted
to
are
you
an
nlp
programmer
btw
dont
think
so
but
i
like
logic
just
been
thinking
about
how
to
do
it
for
7
or
so
years
and
learned
android
was
java
based
this
summer
ive
been
wanting
one
since
i
got
a
computer
and
learned
about
the
internet
like
in
2002
after
lotr
came
out
i
guess
thats
a
coincidence
and
i
just
really
wanted
a
translator
but
havent
seen
one
since
then
and
thought
that
there
must
be
other
people
that
want
one
im
only
doing
it
because
i
need
the
money
it
would
take
way
too
much
time
on
the
side
i
think
its
semirookie
programming
as
this
is
my
first
app
that
isnt
command
line
and
i
am
not
a
compute
scientist
physicist
here
who
likes
complicated
stuff
to
figure
out
to
be
honest
the
proceeds
kinda
will
go
indirectly
to
my
physics
research
by
allowing
me
to
focus
on
them
honestly
if
it
did
well
i
would
make
it
free
to
advertise
my
other
apps
if
i
make
more
but
this
one
seems
to
be
somewhat
short
im
working
alone
though
and
not
for
some
university
or
something
in
research
its
easy
to
learn
a
foreign
language
in
the
us
thanks
for
the
builtin
tldr
not
to
mention
the
icelanders
english
was
such
a
lower
language
that
people
were
executed
for
translating
the
bible
into
english
not
because
of
the
language
but
because
it
put
the
understanding
of
scripture
into
the
hands
of
every
man
rather
than
exclusive
to
the
catholic
priests
had
normal
men
read
it
they
would
have
realised
the
truth
about
justification
by
faith
alone
and
the
priesthood
of
all
believers
and
the
abuse
of
indulgences
luthers
reading
of
scripture
caused
the
reformation
ridley
and
latimer
were
burned
for
opposing
rome
and
tyndale
who
translated
the
scripture
into
common
english
was
burned
for
heresy
but
essentially
because
he
interpreted
faithfully
hence
subverting
the
roman
church
heres
some
useful
stuff
so
what
had
tyndale
done
in
his
translation
that
was
so
heretical
according
to
david
daniell
tyndale
had
translated
the
greek
word
for
elder
as
elder
instead
of
priest
he
had
translated
the
greek
word
for
congregation
as
congregation
instead
of
church
the
greek
word
for
repentance
as
repentance
instead
of
penance
etc
why
were
such
differences
important
to
the
church
the
roman
church
has
priests
not
elders
a
congregation
implies
a
locally
autonomous
group
of
believers
guided
by
the
holy
spirit
and
not
a
hierarchical
unified
church
subject
to
a
pope
the
roman
church
is
built
on
penance
and
indulgences
to
the
priest
and
church
not
repentance
to
and
forgiveness
from
god
see
martin
luthers
95
theses
on
indulgences
the
debate
that
sparked
the
reformation
in
trying
to
faithfully
render
the
greek
into
english
tyndales
translation
exposed
the
errors
of
the
church
to
the
people
which
quickly
brought
the
wrath
of
the
church
down
on
him
did
anyone
else
read
that
with
an
indian
accent
esperanto
requires
a
plurality
that
has
been
simply
unheard
of
until
recently
with
the
major
strides
technology
has
made
towards
connecting
us
it
requires
this
because
otherwise
you
will
always
get
irregulars
of
some
form
due
to
people
being
isolated
in
some
way
to
others
its
also
the
same
reason
different
languages
developed
over
time
instead
of
only
one
language
all
across
it
wouldnt
even
require
creating
a
new
language
or
even
a
new
compiler
keywords
can
be
rewritten
by
a
preprocessor
to
the
c
compiler
im
not
sure
that
having
the
keywords
in
english
helps
native
english
speakers
learn
programming
that
much
the
syntax
and
semantics
are
so
different
from
the
use
of
those
words
in
english
sort
of
i
mean
trying
to
understand
you
would
be
like
trying
to
understand
a
guy
whos
fallingdown
drunk
but
it
helps
if
you
at
least
try
to
use
them
correctly
it
took
me
a
little
while
to
get
comfortable
using
them
but
once
i
did
it
was
easy
i
only
make
occasional
mistakes
now
which
results
in
odd
looks
like
why
did
you
say
horse
when
you
meant
mother
yeah
chinese
is
hard
spanish
is
so
much
easier
maybe
thats
just
for
me
but
i
have
trouble
believing
it
wouldnt
be
easier
for
anybody
whose
native
tongue
did
not
have
tones
which
i
believe
is
most
of
the
nonchinese
speakers
in
the
world
actually
about
half
of
the
worlds
languages
have
tones
theyre
just
obscure
ones
in
east
asia
and
africa
mostly
among
major
languages
i
guess
chinese
is
the
only
one
though
its
not
a
matter
of
its
relation
to
other
languages
tho
its
not
as
closely
related
to
arabic
or
hebrew
really
to
be
useful
in
fact
its
not
even
a
semitic
language
though
its
closer
to
the
semitic
languages
than
it
is
to
any
other
afroasiatic
language
the
difficulty
was
more
that
it
was
in
a
completely
unknown
writing
system
the
symbols
correspond
partially
to
sound
partially
to
morphemes
partially
to
whole
words
so
its
not
so
easy
to
identify
whats
what
nevermind
that
its
also
written
in
two
dimensions
and
we
had
no
idea
what
the
rule
for
reading
it
was
some
of
the
phonetic
characters
can
be
figured
out
from
other
alphabets
in
the
region
no
its
too
complex
to
figure
out
with
that
alone
but
i
suspect
they
couldve
figured
out
a
few
things
yeah
i
havent
written
hebrew
a
whole
lot
recently
its
a
little
rusty
does
cloud
still
mean
rock
as
it
did
in
old
english
does
pistache
still
mean
peanut
in
french
as
it
did
in
middle
french
d
i
have
no
idea
what
back
goat
means
but
im
happy
to
hear
that
its
generic
i
like
the
idea
of
speaking
neutral
english
bad

then
theres
no
such
thing
kind
of
like
a
holorime
but
cross
languageinteresting
concept
thats
really
clever
giggles
are
flooding
me
the
best
thing
is
that
everyone
who
rails
against
the
word
like
almost
certainly
uses
it
in
some
situations
if
theyre
younger
than

even

use

hello
i
have
a
quick
question
that
relates
to
this
an
accent
arises
when
a
persons
native
language
does
not
have
the
sounds
that
are
in
a
different
language
if
the
person
wants
to
speak
the
different
language
but
cannot
product
its
sounds
heshe
looks
for
substitutes
which
sound
similar
but
different
from
the
original
sounds
is
this
correct
i
feel
like
a
historical
linguist
using
a
dictionary
as
a
reference
is
like
a
medical
doctor
using
webmd
as
a
reference
sure
the
information
may
be
accurate
but
theres
something
awkward
about
the
juxtaposition
of
authority
its
almost
certainly
not
true
first
all
of
those
above
languages
havehadalmost
certainly
had
grammatical
gender
second
two
of
them
roman
pictish
had
definitely
no
demonstrable
influence
on
saxon
and
celtic
almost
certainly
none
third
and
most
importantly
many
trading
languages
vulgar
latin
arabic
swahili
greek
spanish
etc
had
strong
grammatical
gender
which
didnt
show
much
levelling
over
time
vulgar
latin
excepted
which
lost
one
gender
not
all
i
was
thinking
about
conlangs
in
general
but
the
title
certainly
implies
that
im
asking
exclusively
about
auxlangs
i
should
probably
add
an
edit
somewhere
saying
so
i
apologize
for
the
misleading
title
in
fact
it
might
be
nonexistantnotaboutlanguage
chomsky
has
repeatedly
said
this
would
be
the
ideal
case
but
that
the
evidence
seems
to
run
counter
to
this
dude
bail
recent
law
grad
here
just
giving
you
the
warning
im
ethically
required
to
give
you
according
to
the
rules
promulgated
by
rlawschool
ah
i
see
thank
you
for
the
swift
reply
rex
omnis
regnum
suum
habet
probably
i
suppose
that
you
already
know
about
japanese
having
quoted
it
in
the
op
but
for
what
its
worth
theres
classifiers
or
count
words
that
necessarily
go
with
numbers
or
rather
one
set
of
numbers
japanese
has
two
sets
of
numbers
the
originally
japanese
ones
are
standalone
ie
they
do
not
go
with
a
classifier
but
they
only
count
things
up
to
10
hitotsu
futatsu
mittsu
yottsu
itsutsu
muttsu
nanatsu
yattsu
kokonotsu
too
then
theres
the
system
thats
adopted
from
chinese
which
does
require
the
classifier
ichiiq
ni
san
shiyonyoq
go
rokuroq
nanashichi
hachihaq
kyuuku
juujuq
with
q
representing
gemination
of
the
following
consonant
these
can
go
over
10
with
some
classifiers
some
numbers
will
be
borrowed
from
the
japanese
set
for
example
the
days
of
the
month
are
especially
confusing
syntactically
numbers
can
be
weird
they
can
either
be
put
as
prenominal
modifiers
shichinin
no
samurai
ga
kita
samurai
that
are
sevenmen
nominative
came
seven
samurai
came
or
they
can
be
put
after
the
noun
and
its
particle
samurai
ga
shichinin
kita
samurai
nominative
sevenmen
came
seven
samurai
came
the
first
one
is
not
exceptional
no
is
often
taken
as
a
genitive
particle
but
is
actually
better
understood
as
a
relative
particle
for
nouns
yeah
i
know
sounds
weird
thus
resist
the
temptation
to
translate
it
as
a
samurais
sevenmen
samurai
such
that
its
sevenmen
or
samurai
that
are
sevenmen
is
much
more
reasonable
the
second
one
though
is
weird
since
i
believe
particles
basically
close
noun
phrases
so
the
numeral
feels
like
its
outside
the
noun
phrase
almost
as
if
it
was
an
adverb
and
not
a
noun
modifier
i
am
not
aware
of
a
meaning
difference
between
the
two
forms
other
than
sticking
a
numeral
japanese
does
not
have
plurals
except
in
special
cases
people
can
be
pluralised
by
tachi

watashii

yamada
and
other
people

mr
yamadas
some
pronouns
can
be
pluralised
with
a
ra
suffix
which
sounds
cruder
or
more
casual
than
tachi
some
nouns
can
be
pluralised
with
reduplication
nonproductive
its
a
fossilised
form
hitoperson
hitobitopeople

hb
it
is
a

but
they
do

hitobito
shichinin
but
hito
shichinin
i
can
confirm
that
there
are
linguists
at
ucsb
that
do
language
documentation
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
taught
in
my
linguistic
classes
in
english
any
vowel
preceding
a
nasal
consonant
becomes
nasalized
because
nasalized
vowels
are
completely
allophonic
in
english
and
occur
in
such
a
specific
context
they
are
rarely
marked
in
all
but
the
very
tightest
ipa
transcriptions
p
m
n
is
there
any
other
place
to
obtain
this
article
that
website
is
telling
me
i
dont
have
access
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
word
pingpong
was
brought
into
chinese
from
english
as
ping
pang
and
graphically
resembles
two
paddles
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
do
not
think
those
characters
are
used
in
any
other
context
when
it
comes
to
learning
languages
the
younger
the
better
children
are
extraordinary
when
it
comes
to
learning
languages
children
are
very
good
at
sorting
out
which
language
is
which
and
barring
any
speech
inhibitions
the
child
may
have
delayed
speech
should
not
be
a
problem
as
for
a
maximum
amount
of
language
i
really
dont
know
if
there
is
a
max
before
a
child
would
become
confused
hopefully
someone
can
comment
on
this
as
for
the
mandarin
this
really
depends
how
much
contact
your
child
will
have
with
using
madarin
since
language
is
a
communicative
device
without
anyone
else
besides
the
mandarin
tutor
to
communicate
with
mandarin
may
be
the
weaker
of
her
three
languages
also
as
a
side
note
assuming
you
live
in
a
country
where
english
is
predominate
it
is
important
that
you
give
as
much
exposure
to
arabic
as
you
can
to
your
daughter
at
home
as
she
will
most
likely
not
use
it
outside
of
that
also
do
not
get
discouraged
if
her
languages
do
not
seem
to
be
developing
simultaneously
and
in
a
balanced
way
this
is
completely
normal
one
language
may
predominate
over
the
others
because
she
is
using
one
language
more
frequently
than
the
others
other
than
that
remember
to
keep
encouraging
your
childs
language
development
and
foster
it
language
learning
flourishes
in
language
rich
environments
so
keep
your
child
interested
in
reading
and
writing
in
addition
to
her
conversational
and
listening
activities
speaking
of
idiolects
can
anyone
point
me
towards
some
texts
on
the
subject
of

ive
read

that
seemed
to
be

than
an

into

more

any

thanks

judged
good
or
bad
as
a
teenager
who

school
as

and
speaks
almost
exclusively
english
now
i
regret
not
devoting
more
time
to
retaining
my
skill
when
i
was
younger
i
hated
chinese
school
hated
speaking
it
and
learning
how
to
write
it
now
i
understand
the
value
of
being
bilingual
and
literate
in
two
languages
especially
one
like
mandarin
my
parents
still
speak
to
me
in
chinese
a
lot
so
i
can
still
understand
a
lot
of
it
however
speaking
it
myself
is
limited
and
my
writing
and
reading
is
even
more
so
my
chinese
is
bad
and
i
do
feel
bad
if
you
have
a
small
child
and
have
the
ability
to
teach
them
a
second
language
do
so
indoctrinate
them
early
on
my
school
was
pure
english
everything
i
did
was
in
english
the
only
time
i
ever
spoke
spanish
was
at
home
i
decided
to
see
if
i
could
find
some
sources
to
support
my
argument
turns
out
i
was
wrong
from
a
pretty
cursory
search
the
literature
seems
to
support
the
value
of
negative
feedback
to
language
learning
in
case
anyone
sees
this
comment
ill
say
again
correcting
childrens
mistakes
has
a
positive
impact
on
their
acquisition
of
a
language
it
is
unclear
if
this
works
for
all
languages
some
seem
more
suited
to
correction
than
others
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
positive
corrections
do
not
seem
to
be
effective
ie
saying
to
a
child
this
word
is
pronounced
like
this
rather
than
simply
pointing
out
that
theyre
pronouncing
it
wrong
this
is
what
i
get
from
being
too
lazy
to
consult
sources
and
relying
on
memory
instead
as
to
memory
before
age
5
or
so
im
not
saying
that
its
not
possible
to
have
memories
from
that
time
of
life
it
is
certainly
possible
and
even
likely
that
you
would
have
memories
from
such
an
early
age
although
many
more
memories
probably
result
from
hearing
and
internalizing
descriptions
of
these
events
later
on
in
life
i
was
pointing
more
to
the
fact
that
linguistic
corrections
are
probably
not
extraordinary
enough
to
merit
a
spot
in
ones
longterm
memory
so
its
unlikely
that
you
would
remember
much
about
being
corrected
on
your
language
at
that
age
then
again
this
just
comes
from
my
own
intuition
and
its
certainly
possible
that
you
do
remember
such
things

i

exposed
only
to

my

to
polish
school
high
school
was
also
french
and
after
that
i
switched
to
english
for
cegep
and
my
university
degrees
now
by
far
my
best
language
is
english
then
french
then
polish
i
actively
make
a
big
effort
to
speak
polish
with
my
parents
brother
and
the
rest
of
my
family
but
it
is
difficult
it
is
very
tempting
and
often
the
easy
way
out
to
just
switch
to
english
my
advice
to
you
do
not
bother
trying
to
incorporate
the
countrys
language
in
the
home
especially
if
it
is
english
it
is
very
pervasive
in
the
day
to
day
life
outside
the
home
that
your
son
will
inevitably
become
proficient
in
it
especiallly
if
he
is
schooled
in
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
even
more
true
if
the
language
of
the
country
is
english
because
i
find
that
it
is
an
extremely
easy
language
if
not
the
simplest
in
the
world
to
learn
just
because
we
have
a
standard
doesnt
mean
we
dont
have
divergence
i
agree
with
this
statement
wholeheartedly
but
there
is
a
caveat
to
the
british
english
example
british
english
had
centuries
before
globalization
to
become
as
dialectical
as
it
has
aha
sorry
to
geek
out
on
you
like
that
thanks
for
the
advice
though
madam

pathologist
here
i
work
in
nursing
facilities
and
have
lots
of
experience
with
geriatric
patients
the
normal
pattern
of
voice
change
over
time
is
for
male
voices
to
rise
in
pitch
and
female
voices
drop
this
has
a
lot
to
do
with
changes
in
hormone
levels
consider
that
hormones
cause
pitch
differentiation
at
puberty
so
it
makes
sense
that
other
changes
would
be
present
as
hormone
levels
taper
off

im

i
dont
know
if
its
a
regionalism
it
might
be
that
i
learned
to
pronounce
the
word
phonetically
from
reading
books
and
stuff
there
many
more
clues
than
that
most
of
the
pronouns
prepositions
and
conjunctions
are
the
same
in
of
on
and
us
we

many

and
good

unpacking
a
compound
like
gedhwamlican
into

its
well
established
that
theres
no
formal
distinction
between
the
terms
language
and
dialect
as
the
terms
are
generally
used
sure
there
are
lots
of
languages
that
are
mutually
intelligible
and
lots
of
dialects
that
arent
but
in
the
prototypical
case
two
languages
are
mutually
unintelligible
and
two
dialects
arent
and
there
are
ways
of
approaching
the
question
are
they
different
languages
without
recourse
to
just
surveying
a
population
gimme
yit
sounds
better
this
is
very
useful
thanks
indeed
and
going
to
be
usable
by
people
is
not
a
matter
of
behaviour
but
of
intent
and
therefore
of
mind
the
poleness
and
the
clubness
are
not
in
the
stick
theyre
in
the
mind
of
the
people
who
planned
to
use
it
as
a
native
speaker
of
swedish
danish
is
surprisingly
difficult
to
understand
my
experience
is
that
danish
people
have
easier
to
understand
swedish
and
norweigian
than
the
opposite
i
disagree
op
asked
why
the
grammar
specifically
seems
more
complicated
in
older
versions
of
some
languages
as
a
native
english
speaker
i
can
recognize
that
say
mandarin
has
extremely
simple
grammar
no
plurals
verbs
arent
declined
nouns
arent
inflected
the
only
real
constraint
is
word
order
whereas
many
more
closely
related
languages
have
a
great
deal
of
rules
governing
usage
so
for
example
if
you
told
a
first
year
language
student
all
the
necessary
words
im
pretty
sure
they
could
create
the
following
sentence
in
grammatical
mandarin
but
not
polish
or
greek
the
bald
man
sent
the
headless
man
five
letters
on
sunday
im
not
a
linguist
so
maybe
you
meant
something
else
sure
spanish
might
be
easier
for
an
english
speaker
to
learn
than
chinese
but
isnt
it
still
more
complex
actually
that
is
not
ironic
but
fitting
my
dad
had
learned
and
spoken
french
and
moroccan
arabic
before
and
during
his
time
as
a
missionary
to
morocco
as
did
my
mother
and
theyre
both
pretty
wordy
people
so
that
one
was
one
of
many
interlanguage
injokes
tog
i
have
no
idea
what
that
means
could
mean
train
bus
tram
van
til
too
but
while
i
dont
think
ill
go
check
my
email
with
speed
in
mind
another
meaning
that
can
be
ascribed
to
mens
is
disposition
you
can
paraphrase
that
as
in
a
speedy
fashion
and
thats
pretty
much
what
i
mean
when
i
use
that
word
for
more
poetic
mindboggling
african
or
very
dated
french
very
often
translates
now
as
presentment
it
would
therefore
mean
with
the
present
in
mind
with
the
present
in
mind
i
will
go
and
check
my
email
with
a
speedy
disposition
you
sound
argumentative
which
i
dont
understand
i
did
not
state
there
was
no
supercategory
word
for
tree
in
english
which
would
be
a
silly
claim
but
neither
did
the
author
of
that
article
make
this
claim
about
gunai
perhaps
the
author
was
trying
to
say
that
but
what
the
author
wrote
was
there
is
no
single
word
in
gunai
for
tree
which
is
not
the
same
as
there
is
no
categorical
or
generic
word
for
tree
there
is
no
single
word
for
tree
in
english
either
in
fact
there
are
hundreds
i
dont
feel
im
being
unduly
pendantic
here
this
distinction
is
important
if
we
want
laypeople
to
regard
linguistics
as
a
scientific
enterprise
far
too
often
the
only
thing
that
the
popular
press
writes
about
strange
foreign
languages
are
tropes
like
they
have
99
words
for
snow
or
they
have
no
word
for
accountability
in
fact
these
are
really
among
the
least
interesting
and
least
true
things
about
those
languages
they
never
say
they
have
singular
dual
paucal
and
plural
numbers
or
they
have
osv
word
order
or
other
things
that
are
linguistically
notable
instead
the
press
jumps
reflexively
onto
tropes
that
seem
to
be
unthoughtfully
fed
by
sapirwhorf
i
know
its
hard
to
write
about
science
for
lay
readers
linguistics
is
particularly
tough
because
everyone
speaks
a
language
and
therefore
thinks
that
they
are
experts
at
language
when
i
suppress
the
1cs
singular
pronoun
which
i
do
even
with
the
linking
verb
am
i
have
two
conscious
reasons
and
possibly
other
unconscious
reasons
1
the
first
is
because
when
i
tried
to
practice
spanish
with
my
roommate
she
scolded
me
for
using
yo
too
much
she
said
it
sounded
at
best
prideful
at
worst
weirdly
emphatic
2
the
second
is
theological
some
ancient
christian
mystics
used
to
avoid
the
1cs
pronouns
because
only
god
can
say
i
or
my
of
something
one
alternative
was
to
fall
back
on
a
third
person
option
like
this
miserable
creature
this
miserable
creature
doesnt
actually
do
that
but
the
story
is
on
her
mind
when
she
says
am
going
to
bed
now
this
project
would
be
hell
for
the
translators
okay
i
overreacted
a
little
bit
i
understand
how
you
were
trying
to
help
now
im
sorry
for
losing
my
temper
that
being
said
while
i
appreciate
your
trying
to
help
discouragement
is
just
not
the
kind
of
help
i
need
some
people
need
that
some
people
are
delusional
and
need
a
reality
check
im
not
those
people
tv
distinction
thanks
this
led
me
to
the
corresponding
wikipedia
entry
15
mins
of
my
life
well
spent
i
know
what
you
mean
by
the
personality
being
affected
this
may
have
less
to
do
with
the
language
though
and
more
to
do
with
the
enthusiasm
the
learner
has
for
the
new
language
for
example
a
desire
to
use
different
sentence
constructions
and
the
subsequent
excitement
of
successfully
doing
so
post
graduation
my
friends
and
i
all
went
into
the
same
field
modulo
bryan
the
musician
as
a
fun
fact
as
with
most
things
where
the
us
and
the
uk
do
something
differently
canada
does
both
in
some
cases
like
variant
pronunciations
of
schism
vase
or
schedule
its
in
variation
but
on
occasion
usuk
differences
get
assigned
values
in
canada
so
a
centre
is
an
institution
like
a
community
centre
or
a
shopping
centre
whereas
a
center
is
the
middle
of
a
thing
and
of
course
now
my
mind
has
blanked
on
other
examples
would
it
not
be
a
variant
of
age
though
it
seems
to
have
the
same
function
where
are
the
nipples
on
an
almond
this
is
actually
getting
rarer
and
rarer
especially
in
soft
scienceshumanities
depending
on
how
your
school
classifies
linguistics
almost
always
you
will
work
some
hours
in
a
lab
or
as
a
ta
or
something
in
addition
to
fulltime
coursework
and
just
your
coursework
is
not
nearly
half
the
work
you
actually
have
to
do
for
a
graduate
program
especially
if
you
want
a
job
after
haha
i
swear
this
isnt
homework
help
i
was
just
curious
and
i
feel
you
bro
working
on
it
now
and
this
shit
is
hard
ah
til
i
guess
its
to
be
expected
many
american
english
speakers
have
no
issue
with
spanish
r
sounds
particularly
those
in
the
west
i
mean
theoretically
you
could
stick
everything
inside
the
root
yolo
one
of
my
old
professors
has
done
some
work
on
this
i
am
not
sure
if
he
reached
any
kind
of
conclusion
but
he
will
certainly
know
if
anyone
else
has
since
he
specialises
in
the
noun
phrase
you
should
shoot
him
an
email
hes
called
jan
rijkhoff
and
works
at
the
university
of
aarhus
denmark
i
recommend
his
work
and
hes
also
a
really
nice
guy
and
why
do
we
say
caff
instead
of
calf
my
dad
and
i
are
both
from
that
same
area
i
say
wolf
and
wolves
he
says
woof
and
wooves
it
always
annoyed
me
im
interested
in
ideas
too
now
languages
are
a
medium
for
ideas
mostly
the
experiences
of
their
language
communities
sometimes
in
the
form
of
literature
and
while
there
are
universal
experiences
each
person
experiences
them
in
different
ways
and
some
chose
to
write
them
down
sometimes
in
a
less
prestigious
dialect
the
invalidity
of
the
sapirwhorf
hypothesis
doesnt
imply
that
different
language
communities
wont
have
different
experiences
and
different
views
of
their
experiences
just
because
its
not
true
that
people
speaking
different
languages
perceive
the
world
in
different
ways
doesnt
mean
that
people
speaking
different
languages
will
have
the
same
experiences
and
the
same
ways
of
dealing
with
them
ie
the
same
culture
thus
its
important
that
communities
speaking
a
less
prestigious
dialect
be
allowed
to
maintain
their
language
from
the
diversity
point
of
view
because
every
obscure
dialect
lost
is
a
loss
for
the
knowledge
of
human
languages
and
cultures
as
a
whole
thats
the
point
i
was
putting
across
initially
if
you
disagree
with
that
then
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
germans
are
prodigious
readers
though
its
a
slight
generational
thing
and
they
are
reading
less
and
less
now
its
amazing
how
many
book
stores
you
can
find
everywhere
there
with
titles
translated
from
every
country
plus
tons
of
their
own
hah
well
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
you
would
consider
a
dialect
and
what
youd
consider
a
language
some
chinese
dialects
deviate
only
a
bit
from
the
standard
while
others
might
as
well
be
their
own
language
the
general
trend
i
seem
to
hear
though
is
that
theyre
all
dialects
if
we
do
want
to
consider
them
all
as
dialects
though
most
of
the
languages
of
europe
might
as
well
be
considered
a
dialect
of
one
language
too
haha
ok
ill
try
to
break
it
down
even
further
because
what
youre
saying
is
what
i
said
8001500
decent
ability
to
communicate
15003000
newspaper
and
other
literature
3000
advanced
communicative
ability
and
readingwriting
thats
what
i
stated
and
thats
what
youre
seemingly
describing
i
agree
with
youi
speak
mandarin
and
taiwanese
but
im
not
a
sinologist
so
i
do
have
some
experience
with
chinese
characters
i
was
merely
sharing
my
own
experience
and
what
ive
heard
consistently
over
my
years
of
learning
u
as
in
you
you
are
not
alone
there
is
no
proper
way
its
called
accent
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
there
were
varying
ways
of
pronouncing
things
but
i
guess
i
was
wrong
every
time
someone
says
literally
i
am
literally
reminded
of
rob
lowes
character
on
parks
and
recreation
do
i
know
you
are
you
considering
india
northern
africa
persian
countries
and
the
many
greater
middle
east
countriesarmenia
turkey
israel
or
eurasian
countries
like
russia
that
are
part
of
the
list
as
being
europealthough
overlap
does
occur
when
you
make
that
statement
no
the
katakana
characters
used
are
pa
i
and
n
so
it
would
be
pronounced
pain
ipa
they
do
the
same
thing
to
anyone
with
a
provincial
accent
too
this
is
why
i
shouldnt
reddit
at
night
while
drunk
i
am
in
no
way
an
expert
on
romance
languages
but
i
have
been
told
by
speakers
of
rumansch
that
they
can
communicate
with
catalan
speakers
unfortunately
i
have
nothing
beyond
the
anecdotal
thats
what
i
mean
and
the
reason
is
100
political
as
part
of
spain
and
france
our
language
is
not
official
in
the
eu
so
catalan
is
not
covered
by
the
europarl
corpus
be
us
independent
and
part
of
the
eu
our
language
would
be
official
and
on
that
corpus
so
political
reasons
not
technical
ones
interestingly
the
korean
iteration
of
arbeit
is
translated
on
that
map
as
ferienarbeit
which
if
my
terrible
german
serves
me
right
would
translate
to
vacation
work
maybe
something
like
summer
job
is
a
better
translation
i
always
thought
the
korean
and
japanese
iterations
were
basically
the
same
any
sort
of
parttime
noncareer
work
typically
done
by
young
peoplestudents
not
exactly
on
your
question
but
closely
related
theres
a
weak
point
to
your
question
whats
a
contraction
the
classic
linguistic
article
on
english
contractions
is
zwicky
and
pullum
1983
and
its
demonstrates
that
theres
no
unified
notion
of
a
contraction
in
english
contractions
like
shouldnt
cant
and
wont
differ
grammatically
from
contractions
like
wouldve
or
shes
the
negative
ones
are
actually
verbal
conjugations
the
latter
ones
are
reduced
words
in
light
of
this
youre
getting
some
pretty
wild
answers
in
this
thread
because
the
only
common
thread
to
the
bulk
of
the
answers
seems
to
be
oh
hey
i
know
very
little
about
linguistics
but
i
know
that
in
language
x
you
dont
pronounce
suchandsuch
letter
or
we
write
this
thing
with
an
apostrophe
examples
spanish
sweakening
has
nothing
to
do
with
either
inflection
or
reduced
words
its
just
a
systematic
phonological
rule
in
some
dialects
that
affects
the
phoneme
s
at
ends
of
words
or
syllables
spanish
pa
para
is
just
a
colloquial
vs
formal
distinction
in
some
dialects
arguing
that
pa
is
a
contraction
of
para
is
like
arguing
that
english
yeah
is
a
contraction
of
yes
english
ve
is
a
reduced
word
because
it
has
some
idiosyncratic
restrictions
eg
you
cant
answer
have
you
eaten
already
with
ive
spanish
pa
has
no
such
restrictions
spanish
pall
is
just
pa
plus
a
general
phonological
rule
that
reduces
two
adjacent
vowels
to
just
one
in
informal
speech
you
see
it
all
over
the
place
eg
de
l
is
routinely
pronounced
del
in
informal
speech
many
french
contractions
are
best
seen
as
inflections
just
like
english
nt
for
example
theres
no
plausible
rule
to
reduce
de

in

it

still

oops
i
missed
that
thats
what
i
get
for
reading
too
quickly
theres
a
difference
between
not
using
accents
and
hoygan
shudder
there
are
only
a
few
places
with
ceceo
where
all
instances
of
s
become
t
edit
capitalisation
this
is
what
i
mean
the
visual
depiction
conveys
meaning
but
no
phonetic
difference
is
that
not
tantamount
to
a
logogram
what
is
written
with
th
resembles
not
one
sound
not
even
one
phoneme
its
two
phonemes
namely
and
many
languages
in
europe
lack
at
least
one
of
these
but
not
all
as
you
said
castilian
has
both
there
are
also
some
french
dialects
in
switzerland
using
danish
and
some
swedish
dialect
whose
name
i
cant
remember
right
now
both
have
in
danish
its
not
distinctive
though
and
if
you
count
icelandic
and
faroese
as
being
european
both
are
germanic
but
in
europe
only
politically
speaking
add
another
two
to
your
list
i
guess
there
are
more
especially
when
you
include
dialects
and
not
only
standard
languages
agesexlocation
the
video
isnt
really
referencing
students
in
the
competitive
programs
though
is
it
its
referencing
students
who
attend
runofthemill
universities
andor
the
kinds
of
places
where
people
take
out
loans
to
pay
for
their
degrees
and
the
university
happily
takes
it
plenty
of
them
have
posted
on
rgradschool
in
the
past
with
questions
like
how
much
debt
is
reasonable
to
take
on
and
is
100000
too
much
to
pay
for
grad
school
recently
i
saw
someone
on
that
subreddit
state
that
they
wouldnt
consider
taking
on
more
than
30k
in
loans
under
that
and
its
fine
your
argument
is
that
most
competitive
programs
offer
full
funding
which
i
admit
is
the
case
my
argument
which
ill
clarify
here
is
that
your
average
program
isnt
all
that
competitive
by
definition
and
in
those
average
programs
plenty
of
people
pay
for
their
degrees
i
will
correct
my
above
statement
from
every
program
out
there
has
these
people
to
every
average
program
has
these
people
for
the
people
i
know
fear
of
failure
keeps
them
enrolled
im
really
glad
that
there
are
universities
that
offer
standalone
ma
programs
its
the
norm
in
my
home
country
for
those
who
dont
want
to
become
academics
and
who
need
a
masters
level
degree
to
go
into
a
certain
line
of
work
its
perfect
and
its
really
great
for
international
students
for
those
who
really
want
to
become
academics
in
what
is
a
very
competitive
job
market
its
possibly
not
be
the
best
idea
haitian
creole
was
probably
not
the
best
choice
for
you
since
the
phonology
is
quite
similar
to
french
no
lexical
stress
largely
similar
phonological
inventory
but
differences
in
nasalization
and
where
r
may
be
found
and
there
arent
really
that
many
loanwords
from
african
languages
a
few
examples
from
frysk
thank
you
thats
the
first
decent
description
ive
seen
of
upsids
languages
and
the
goals
in
choosing
them
very
very
helpful
now
can
i
reasonably
claim
that
shows
up
in
less
than
3
of
the
worlds
languages
they
claim
244
occurance
in
upsid
i
was
happy
going
into
this
but
it
became
too
much
of
edutainment
for
me
when
they
started
taking
listener
calls
well
i
know
that
the
cluster
kn
does
no
longer
exist
in
english
even
though
you
once
had
it
its
still
visible
in
spelling
though
eg
in
the
words
knight
and
knee
hes
a
much
better
writer
than
this
gives
credit
to
consensus
this
is
ling
100
in
a
45
minute
video
minus
memorizing
the
ipa
velaric
is
different
than
velar
djdoubleyew
is
referring
to
the
airstream
mechanism
used
to
produce
clicks
since
this
doesnt
cause
problems
in
real
life
its
clear
that
speakers
have
two
distinct
entries
for
couple
in
their
mental
lexicon
exactly
like
how
you
have
no
issue
sorting
out
the
meaning
of
handful
in
the
sentences
he
has
a
handful
of
change
and
our
new
puppy
is
quite
a
handful
so
that
means
he
fits
into
a
big
hand
could
any
of
you
explain
to
me
li5
what
the
benefits
to
learning
ipa
are
i
took
a
quick
look
at
the
wikipedia
page
but
didnt
really
get
too
much
out
of
it
does
it
allow
you
to
express
pronunciation
of
other
languages
in
a
standard
alphabet
consonants
produced
with
the
tip
of
the
tongue
are
apical
consonants
produced
with
the
blade
of
the
tongue
are
laminal
some
languages
distinguish
the
two
eg
basque
but
most
dont
in
languages
that
dont
distinguish
them
people
will
generally
cluster
on
either
one
of
them
but
youll
see
some
variations
among
speakers
since
they
generally
wont
hear
the
difference
it
also
depends
if
english
is
your
first
language
since
romance
languages
and
others
tend
to
use
laminals
tldr
its
very
possible
that
you
do
pronounce
them
with
the
blade
of
your
tongue
youll
have
to
ignore
my
ignorance
here
but
by
that
do
you
mean
he
and
she
is
finnish
inflective
for
genders
too
im
learning
slovak
as
i
live
here
in
slovakia
but
being
british
the
idea
of
inflection
is
difficult
enough
to
grasp
ive
never
actually
heard
this
who
says
these
things
italian
volere
la
botte
piena
e
la
moglie
ubriaca
equivalent
to
the
english
to
have
ones
cake
and
eat
it
translates
literally
as
to
want
the
barrel
full
and
ones
wife
drunk
yes
come
to
think
of
it
youre
right
i
didnt
think
before
i
wrote
what
i
did
traditional
prescriptivist
grammar
demands
you
and
i
but
descriptivistically
you
and
me
is
much
more
common
at
least
in
the
uk
english
seriously
needs
some
emphatic
pronouns
like
frenchs
moi
toi
etc
in
fact
lets
just
adopt
them
as
they
are
just
as
smart
as
toi
and
moi
a
typo
yeah
youre
right
some
linguists
use
eg
statistics
on
a
daily
basis
i
actually
took
a
few
statistics
classes
myself
i
also
agree
that
people
have
a
completely
distorted
view
of
the
humanities
i
have
friends
who
are
doing
a
literature
degree
and
not
one
of
them
hasnt
complained
about
people
asking
them
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
a
literature
degree
its
no
use
in
the
real
world
bloody
hell
and
people
always
assume
that
im
going
to
be
a
teacher
in
secondary
school
just
because
im
doing
a
linguistics
degree
oh
so
youre
going
to
be
a
teacher
no
thats
one
option
yes
but
not
the
only
one
i
seriously
wish
people
would
either
think
before
they
talk
or
just
shut
their
faces
im
originally
from
edmonton
myself
though
i
have
a
somewhat
odd
vowel
space
according
to
some
analyses
that
ive
had
to
do
for
homework
kejt
is
how
i
was
originally
taught
to
transcribe
it
ive
more
recently
been
convinced
that
ket
is
more
usual
regardless
the
point
of
the
sentences
is
to
teach
the
monophthongs
even
though
some
of
them
rarely
occur
on
their
own
they
can
and
do
and
knowing
what
the
monophthong
looks
and
sounds
like
is
really
useful
if
you
want
to
try
out
diphthongs
that
arent
in
english
mow
is
also
a
possible
transcription
but
for
many
english
speakers
the
only
place
that
open
o
exists
is
before
while
it
is
not
in
all
dialects
it
is
often
considered
a
standard
part
of
english
lwd
is
definitely
higher
than
i
produce
it
but
i
can
see
how
some
dialects
do
use
this
my
transcription
looks
wierd
and
i
dont
know
if
i
fully
agree
with
it
but
it
is
one
that
i
have
been
taught
for
that
diphthong
im
surprised
by
your
bajks
i
would
expect
canadian
raising
to
occur
due
to
the
following
voiceless
stop
raising
has
also
been
transcribed
in
various
ways
mine
being
one
your
other
transcriptions
are
fairly
convincing
thanks
for
taking
time
to
compare
your
transcriptions
i
use
these
for
very
beginners
so
it
is
good
to
see
competing
opinions
that
may
make
the
mnemonic
not
useful
for
particular
speakers
also
please
dont
let
this
question
get
into
your
head
that
informal
speech
is
bad
speech
thank
you
a
sociolinguist
as
taktubu
mentioned
they
are
also
in
hmong
xhosa
juhoansi
goes
further
than
breathy
voiced
with
voicedaspirated
regarding
dravidian
languages
tamil
doesnt
have
any
breathy
voiced
consonants
and
telugu
kannada
malayalam
speakers
the
other
major
dravidian
languages
usually
use
them
only
for
loan
words
from
sanskrit
though
the
breathy
voiced
consonants
are
a
part
of
the
alphabet
for
these
languages
really
its
just
a
matter
of
how
you
define
invention
to
me
an
invention
has
a
connotation
of
intent
and
reasoning
its
something
someone
has
to
purposefully
think
about
at
some
point
since
no
one
ever
sat
down
and
wondered
what
would
be
the
best
name
for
each
thing
i
wouldnt
call
languages
an
invention
but
i
can
see
how
someone
would
define
invention
to
be
more
or
less
equivalent
to
creation
yes
of
course
every
language
was
created
by
humans
so
in
this
sense
they
are
inventions
we
can
keep
talking
about
it
but
lets
keep
in
mind
that
we
are
discussing
the
definition
of
invention
not
the
matter
of
fact
of
how
languages
came
about
new
englander
here
its
unrelated
to
the
ncvs
but
sounds
similar
to
some
people
ncvs
uses
the
vowel
of
father
there
new
england
has
the
fatherbother
distinction
and
uses
the
vowel
from
bother
its
a
different
vowel
which
people
from
outside
new
england
have
trouble
hearing
as
distinct
from
father
edit
also
the
boston
accent
is
more
related
to
east
anglia
than
ireland
note
that
ireland
is
rhotic
but
boston
traditionally
isnt
eh
you
asked
if
i
was
familiar
with
it
i
simply
replied
that
id
heard
of
it
but
cant
speak
it
i
dont
understand
what
youre
getting
at
i
agree
with
you
what
language
was
not
invented
or
made
up
if
a
language
is
not
invented
whats
the
alternative
method
of
origin
youre
welcome
i
think
thats
your
whole
argument
right
there
newton
did
once
say
that
he
did
not
seek
to
invent
any
hypotheses
which
sounds
strange
to
the
modern
ear
but
totally
acceptable
in
his
day
most
redditors
here
are
regurgitating
the
whole
invention
wise
men
sitting
down
with
blueprints
shtick
when
the
process
of
the
invention
of
a
tool
any
tool
was
far
more
slapdash
than
that
you
should
have
used
constructed
which
definitely
has
a
stronger
connotation
of
artifice
but
it
appears
you
have
initiated
a
judgment
of
paris
for
the
fairest
then
when
you
get
down
to
articulation
there
are
a
lot
of
theories
about
how
exactly
we
coordinate
and
execute
the
required
movements
and
how
this
relates
to
language
acquisition
the
simple
answer
is
almost
a
truism
english
doesnt
have
a
wordinitial
so
english
speakers
have
no
practice
making
them
yeah
theres
even
often
trouble
going
both
ways
with
other
languages
that
use
articles
but
use
them
differently
like
french
i
hear
groups
of
men
referred
to
as
the
boys
quite
frequently
but
never
individually
i
also
hear
girls
as
a
group
term
but
rarely
as
an
individual
term
though
it
is
less
rare
than
hearing
boy
as
an
individual
term
still
people
who
are
your
peers
ie
around
your
age
are
guys
not
boys
if
they
are
male
if
theyre
female
they
continue
to
be
girls
although
once
you
get
into
a
more
formal
setting
i
suppose
men
and
women
become
more
appropriate
ive
seen
this
a
lot
in
im
or
texting
for
example
typing
a
at
the
end
of
a
conversation
means
a
plus
tard
see
you
later
in
thai
im
and
texting
they
write
555555555
for
lolololol
because
5
is
pronounced
ha
i
had
a
ta
for
a
gen
ed
once
she
was
studying
bulgarian
literature
at
one
point
she
mentioned
that
bulgarian
doesnt
have
swears
and
instead
has
exclamations
like
three
hundred
hairy
bears
but
i
also
just
was
able
to
find
bulgarian
swear
words
after
a
few
seconds
of
googling
so
maybe
it
was
another
language
the
speech
accent
archive
is
the
closest
thing
i
can
think
of
i
dont
know
of
a
comparable
resource
where
the
speakers
are
being
interviewed
as
i
understand
it
the
pressure
in
the
cavity
composed
of
the
closed
vocal
folds
and
the
occlusion
caused
by
the
tongue
or
lips
must
be
greater
than
the
external
pressure
to
produce
an
audible
sound
so
maybe
the
absolute
ambient
air
pressure
wouldnt
matter
given
that
its
all
about
relative
pressure
anyways
and
yeah
having
to
shout
over
the
galeforce
winds
of
everest
would
probably
muck
up
some
data
west
frisian
has
dialects
called
clay
frisian
and
wood
frisian
thats
gotta
be
my
favourite
i
had
always
thought
that
liverpudlian
was
some
sort
of
insult
that
just
stuck
after
years
and
years
being
that
a
puddle
is
a
smaller
version
of
a
pool
but
that
could
just
be
me
not
being
from
the
uk
i
had
no
idea
about
the
varieties
of
names
especially
the
orkney
and
the
wolverhampton
ones
i
could
have
lived
1000
years
without
guessing
them
as
for
scouser
i
have
a
cooking
book
random
i
know
that
says
scouse
comes
from
the
norwegian
lapskaus
meaning
stew
apparently
liverpool
was
inundated
with
foreign
sailors
many
from
norway
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
and
that
was
their
main
dish
not
sure
if
its
true
but
it
works
for
me
im
afraid
i
misread
marocoroman3s
comment
and
he
and
you
are
completely
right
but
im
is
a
contraction
of
iam
not
amnot
the
rest
can
do
both
hes
not
he
isnt
theyre
not
they
arent
thats
what
i
mean
its
used
pretty
commonly
now
and
everybody
on
this
subreddit
knows
that
language
is
constantly
evolving
even
if
it
hasnt
been
officially
recognized
people
use
the
word
often
its
already
a
part
of
our
language
but
they
didnt
have
audio
recordings
in
antiquity
im
basically
in
the
same
boat
as
you
although
my
school
is
somewhat
known
for
their
theoretical
ling
ive
also
considered
the
options
that
you
had
i
decided
to
spend
1
year
abroad
and
come
appreciate
the
experience
but
not
seeing
my
self
doing
this
for
a
long
time
ive
decided
to
go
the
computational
route
havent
started
yet
and
still
considering
some
slp
ideas
as
for
tefl
if
you
havent
decided
anything
yet
by
the
time
you
graduate
spend
a
year
abroad
there
you
can
decide
whether
you
like
teaching
or
not
as
well
as
giving
yourself
more
time
to
decide
edit
my
gpa
was
just
under
35
and
my
departmental
average
was
37
which
in
my
school
is
on
the
average
side
shakespeare
yeah
like
doctor
which
means
healer
and
wise
man
and
mighty
warrior
we
have
youre
not
and
we
have
you
arent
op
is
wondering
why
we
dont
have
i
amnt
in
addition
to
im
not
dont
worry
i
already
removed
it
its
maybe
true
that
minimalism
is
agnostic
as
to
constraints
from
the
interface
but
i
seem
to
remember
a
probabalist
being
eviscerated
at
nels
2008
for
daring
to
suggest
there
were
gasp
numbers
in
the
grammar
can
we
really
call
the
system
that
dolphins
and
whales
use
to
communicate
a
language
im
not
ready
to
say
that
i
dont
really
get
this
terminology
shouldnt
sentences
marked
with
if
be
conditional
ie
describing
conditions
its
really
appalling
how
bad
the
spanish
translations
of
some
widelyused
informational
signs
are
especially
given
that
im
in
los
angeles
youd
think
theyd
be
able
to
find
a
native
speaker
that
wouldnt
totally
mangle
the
translations
but
i
guess
not
becoming
a
d
would
make
it
voiced
and
yes
as
a
east
coaster
i
say
vamn
in

is
neutral

maybe
with
a
little
bit
of
northeast
and
southeast
thrown
in
i
have
lived
in
both
areas
and
both
areas
think
i
talk
oddly
the
middle
vowel
is
a
schwa
not
likely
at
most
youll
find
languages
which
conjugate
their
verbs
so
that
the
1st
person
form
stands
out
and
thus
an
extra
pronoun
isnt
necessary
in
spoken
serbian
you
tend
to
skip
on
pronouns
due

i
saw
a

of

shoes
at
the
store
the
auxiliary
sam
is
already
so
inflected
that
it
indicates
the
1st
person
so
that
the
pronoun
ja
i
isnt
necessary
quite
colloquial
though
other
languages
do
this
as
well
afaik
though
its
downright
slang
in
some
of
them
maybe
its
just
me
but
i
dont
usually
see
war
alone
as
a
verb
but
dictionaries
do
about
a
month
ago
i
made
a
comment
on
a
rworldnews
thread
about
the
rapid
pace
of
language
death
i
was
inundated
with
comments
telling
me
that
language
death
is
a
great
thing
and
that
we
should
all
be
pleased
with
it
and
eventually
everyone
will
speak
english
and
well
all
get
along
oh
and
of
course
you
dont
want
languages
to
die
youre
a
linguist
so
you
get
paid
if
they
survive
why
should
we
care
i
have
a
degree
and
i
work
in
a

i
know
how
to
talk
in
russian
but
my

is
terrible
insert

ha
ha
try
the
girl
sent
the

was
pleased
still
not
natural
imo
what
language
this
is
wrong
on
so
many
levels
they
arent
somewhat
lexically
not
lexiconally
similar
they
are
very
similar
lexically
they
have
substantial
phonology
differences
and
also
some
grammatical
differences
but
the
question
wasnt
how
they
are
different
but
why
the
answer
to
that
is
geography
and
politics
portugal
was
a
separate
kingdom
from
spain
and
that
contributed
to
its
standardization
castilian
won
out
over
other
regional

of

due
to
similar
reasons
also

shortly
after

actually
you
alexdodge
peteraitch
alexanderkaras
and
others
in
this

would
do
well
to
look
at
dictionaries
of
linguistics
such
as
a
dictionary
of
linguistics
and
phonetics
by
david
crystal
2008
the
oxford
concise

of

by
peter
matthews

and
a
dictionary
of

terms
in
linguistics
by
rl
trask
1993
all
three
note
both
usages
for
the
word
ergative
with
the
latter
two
suggesting
that
it
might
best
be
avoided
but
both
usages
ie
1
marking
subjects
of
transitive
verbs
differently
than
objects
of
transitive
verbs
subjects
of
intransitive
verbs
and
2
describing
verbs
whose
transitive
object
is
the
same
as
its
intransitive
subject
are
used
widely
in
the
field
trask

says
that
seely

gives
a

i
dont

how
much
of
an

the

would
be
frankly
does
that

happen
in

and
is
it
variable
in
czech
or
fully
lexicalized
and
perhaps
ops
friend
just
knows
russians
with
well
i
have
very
little
first
hand
experience
with
the
legal
system
but
isnt
a
large
part
of
a
lawyers
job
the
interpretation
and
arguing
of
the
meaning
and
intent
of
the
law
once
a
precedent
is
set
for
the
way
in
which
a
statement
is
interpreted
it
will
continue
to
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
in
similar
cases
in
other
words
they
dont
just
take
the
word
of
the
laws
word
for
it
they
examine
it
and
argue
it
and
look
at
how
its
been
interpreted
in
the
past
so
i
think
there
are
already
safeguards
against
the
problem
you
raise
also
changes
updates
and
amendments
do
happen
in
addition
language
change
is
not
something
thats
really
on
everyones
mind
how
would
you
have
society
code
rules
and
expectations
if
not
through
the
written
word
its
the
best
weve
got
for
the
purpose
very
true
but
its
still
a
language
without
a
definedrequired
syntax
which
i
how
i
read
the
question
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
a
lot
of
these
are
mormonisms
you
can
see
a
lot
of
them
also
in
the
movie
napoleon
dynamite
whose
creators
actually
did
a
significant
amount
of
research
into
how
mormons
talk
hint
its
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
taboo
avoidance
and
minced
oaths
is
it
possible
to
coin
new
words
in
a
language
thats
almost
dead
yea
body
parts
are
pretty
interesting
to
look
into
as
for
what
you
were
saying
about
nonequal
translation
your
examples
remind
me
of
the
farsi
word
dast
which
means
armhand
there
is
no
distinction
made
between
the
two
if
i
remember
correctly
the
wals
website
took
a
look
at
the
handarm
distinction
and
where
it
was
distributed
around
the
world
and
there
was
a
trend
for
languages
that
have
no
distinction
between
hand
and
arm
to
be
located
near
the
equator
and
one
of
the
theories
they
came
up
with
was
that
traditional
clothing
might
have
influenced
this
basically
in
warmer
climates
there
was
less
of
a
tradition
of
covering
up
the
arm
making
it
more
likely
to
be
seen
as
a
whole
while
in
colder
climates
clothing
items
such
as
gloves
and
such
could
have
created
the
need
for
a
specific
word
for
describing
the
hand
individually
laymans
explanation
i
guess
the
point
is
its
only
weird
to
you
because
youre
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
native
language
and
culture
perfect
1
to
1
translations
are
probably
not
the
norm
i
dont
like
it
as
a
student
with
aspirations
of
becoming
an
interpreter
it
makes
me
afraid
for
my
future
you
cant
keep
it
exactly
the
same
becasue
each
languages
makes
different
sound
distinctions
even
people
who
speak
multiple
languages
have
a
different
voice
in
each
language
but
yes
the
voice
sounds
robotic

im

there

on

i
share
this
feeling
we
only
capitalize

and
no

are
not
proper

it
gets
described
as
that
very
often
by
people
explaining
the

merger
this
kind
of
distinction
can
be
useful
for
showing
a
clear
difference
between
and
since
many
of
these
accents
dont
actually
have
an
phoneme
phonetically
though
it
is
often
actually
more
like
when
i
was
younger
i
pronounced
this
as
a

right
on
everything
except
for
the

his
the

is
actually
a
relic
of
the
oldmiddle
english
genitive
case
check
it
out
ive
often
heard
that
hindi
and
urdu
are
essentially
the
same
language
and
if
not
they
are
verrrry
mutually
intelligible
just
the
same
i
would
expect
that
your
intuition
regarding
the
language
is
correct
but
i
wouldnt
know
since
i
dont
speak
any
south
asian
languages
this
doesnt
contribute
to
the
conversation
as
productively
but
its
a
related
tidbit
which
i
think
is
interesting
the
example
you
gave
of
english
and
german
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
we
know
that
the
angles
the
tribe
that
english
is
named
after
moved
to
the
british
isles
from
northern
europe
an
area
that
was
run
by
various
germanic
tribes
at
the
time
a
connection
which
i
believe
was
actually
found
through
linguistics
rather
than
by
historians
or
anthropologists
or
anything
was
the
indoeuropean
connection
mentioned
in
proto
indoeuropean
there
was
a
linguistearly
20th
century
i
believe
who
noted
the
similarities
between
sanskrit
and
some
european
languages
and
we
found
that
a
lot
of
languages
like
hindi
farsi
etc
are
related
to
european
languages
im
a
novice
at
best
so
if
i
misspoke
someone
please
correct
me
yes
its

grew
up
hearing
uff

in
the

as
well
lots
of
scandinavians

too
i
dont
understand
this
language
so
clearly
its
speakers
dont
also
racism
what
about
this

linguistic

is
concerned
primarily
with
an
ideal

in
a
completely

who
knows
its
the

perfectly
and
is
unaffected
by
such
grammatically
irrelevant
conditions
as

limitations

and
errors

or

haha
awesome
dr
chomskys
responses
to
our
ama
has
been
delayed
sounds
pretty
nonstandard
to
my
north
american
english
instincts
my
rural
grandparents
might
say
it
as
above
just
interested
is
all
weird
i
also
saw
him
in
an
elevator
last
week
it
was
at
the
mit
medical
center
but
he
did
not
look
sick
yeah
that
could
be
the
case
i
also
considered
that
the
phrase
was
initially
hes
mad
mad
is
what
he
is
before
the
second
mad
underwent
ellipsis
the
thing
is
that
phrase
and
yours
both
feature
a
pause
which
doesnt
occur
in
hes
mad
is
what
he
is
so
unless
the
pause
gets
deleted
as
well
it
feels
unlikely
that
thats
the
correct
analysis
this
is
part
of
the
reason
why
im
asking
for
crosslinguistic
data
too
though
see
whether
there
are
any
languages
where
this
kind
of
construction
is
considered
standard
please
consider
this
sub
instead
of
rlinguistics
right
tallness
is
the
distance
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
height
is
the
position
of
the
top
i
absolutely
think
bad
words
provide
value
i
think
we
continue
to
label
some
words
bad
because
doing
so
makes
them
particularly
salient
which
is
exactly
how
we
use
them
we
use
them
to
express
vehemence
strong
emotions
and
as
intensifiers
if
they
werent
taboo
they
would
fail
to
be
so
expressive
theres
a
huge
difference
between
me
saying
im
really
hungry
and
im
fucking
hungry
in
the
latter
im
so
hungry
that
im
bordering
on
anger
hangry
i
really
want
you
to
know
that
im
hungry
so
i
use
the
word
that
will
make
you
notice
it
most
i
dont
personally
see
it
as
a
class
thing
im
just
going
to
copypaste
my
answer
from
rasksocialscience
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
languages
formality
which
is
a
nebulous
concept
to
begin
with
the
causes
of
language
change
are
many
and
varied
and
different
people
have
different
ideas
about
it
depending
on
how
they
assume
language
is
representedexists
in
the
mind
there
are
also
different
ways
language
can
change
from
sound
systems
to
word
use
to
syntax
so
just
taking
english
as
an
example
a
few
things
i
know
words
can
be
introduced
from
other
languages
and
this
can
in
turn
influence
the
sound
system
for
example
the
sound
as
in
azure
or
the
final
consonant
in
garage
depending
on
your
dialect
entered
the
english
sound
system
via
borrowings
from
french
vowels
shift
around
a
lot
the
great
vowel
shift
happened
in
the
transition
from
early
middle
english
to
modern
english
but
a
more
recent
one
is
the
northern
cities
shift
people
seem
to
have
a
preference
for
disambiguating
vowels
so
when
for
whatever
reason
one
vowel
moves
along
the
vowel
space
and
is
produced
differently
the
other
vowels
start
sliding
around
too
to
maximize
the
difference
the
why
in
this
kind
of
sound
change
has
different
theories
of
varying
degrees
of
silliness
one
is
the
influence
of
french
as
mentioned
above
another
has
to
do
with
the
rise
of
the
middle
class
and
a
more
standardized
dialect
yet
another
blames
the
black
plague
less
people
means
a
more
homogeneous
sound
john
ohala
did
a
paper
called
the
listener
as
a
source
of
sound
change
talked
about
acoustic
motivations
of
sound
change
the
listener
may
be
incorrectly
factoring
out
sound
information
or
incorrectly
factoring
in
erroneous
information
from
a
speaker
words
or
groups
of
words
can
change
due
to
analogy
or
comparison
to
something
else
in
the
language
so
you
get
regularization
of
verbs
like
drived
from
drove
and
misapplication
of
irregular
vowels
like
brung
from
bring
the
word
forehead
originally
rhymed
with
horrid
but
it
was
reanalyzed
because
people
compared
it
to
the
word
head
a
napron
and
an
ewt
became
an
apron
and
a
newt
words
themselves
can
also
change
meaning
or
nuance
words
can
perjorate
or
take
on
negative
meanings
eg
spinster
becomes
unmarried
older
woman
from
person
who
spins
due
to
association
you
see
in
the
recent
past
with
words
like
idiot
or
moron
more
rarely
words
can
ameliorate
to
gain
a
more
positive
meaning
queen
was
an
ollllld
word
for
woman
or
they
can
just
change
meaning
with
connotation
gay
to
mean
homosexual
i
cant
really
comment
on
syntactic
or
morphemic
change
but
i
hope
that
answers
your
question
at
least
in
part
the
word
order
in
russian
is
almost
absolutely
free
which
makes
extreme
topicalization
edit
the
term
is
scrambling
i
guess
appear
in
colloquial
speech
for
example
the
words
in
the
phrase
i
went
to
the
shop
can
be
arranged
i
went
to
the
shop
i
to
the
shop
went
went
i
to
the
shop
went
to
the
shop
i
to
the
shop
i
went
to
the
shop
went
i
while
maintaining
grammatical
correctness
source
i
know
that
the
san
are
one
of
the
three
groups
san
australian
aboriginals
sioux
indians
most
famous
for
sign
language
use
developed
in
hunting
and
presumably
as
a
nonauditory
alternative
to
whispering
signed
languages
can
be
whispered
by
producing
smaller
signs
in
a
smaller
signing
space
and
sometimes
hiding
behind
an
object
please
dont
trust
everything
you
read
about
pirah
sofree
morphemes
the
problem
is
it
being
a
living
language
with
several
varieties
its
in
constant
flux
even
a
list
that
would
be
complete
in
the
moment
i
press
save
on
this
comment
which
is
itself
an
impossible
task
would
risk
becoming
incomplete
within
days
words
die
words
are
born
and
there
are
plenty
of
processes
in
between
even
though
one
obviously
cant
change
voice
tones
whilst
whispering
i
can
still
change
the
pitch
and
intonation
of
the
sound
whilst
whispering
by
manipulating
the
shape
of
my
mouth
kind
of
imagine
you
are
making
the
sound
of
wind
its
not
voice
its
a
whisper
where
one
modifies
the
pitch
of
the
wind
by
modifying
the
shape
of
the
lips
so
with
those
four
examples
i
can
recognise
two
different
sounds
obviously
unrelated
to
voicedvoiceless
b
voiced
high
pitch
p
voiced
high
pitch
b
voiced
high
pitch
p
voiced
high
pitch
apart
from
these
four
examples
its
also
pretty
easy
to
use
the
high
tone
dipping
tone
and
low
tone
using
that
method
its
still
a
change
in
tone
ie
pitch
just
using
a
method
other
than
voice
never
heard
of
the
guy
it
definitely
is
one
of
the
right
subs
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
the
same
things
comes
into
play
with
cats
too
there
is
a
lot
of
issue
with
cat
owners
and
scratching
and
primarily
trying
to
get
them
to
scratch
on
a
post
rather
than
on
something
similarly
textured
like
carpet
or
furniture
it
seems
to
the
the
case
at
least
with
our
cat
once
you
let
him
go
to
town
on
one
thing
he
really
doesnt
seem
to
understand
that
he
cant
play
with
other
things
of
the
same
texture
size
would
be
interesting
havent
seen
that
come
into
play
i
would
also
not
be
surprised
if
cues
like
scent
are
important
to
dogs
since
of
course
they
have
a
more
sensitive
nose
than
humans
do
this
is
discussed
a
lot
when
you
study
animals
how
do
animals
think
as
far
as
i
know
we
dont
know
yet
i
think
someone
might
have
said
that
in
a
syntax
class
once
upon
a
time
german
is
v2
and
old
english
also
was
v2
but
if
you
go
by
the
article
oe
isnt
the
ancestor
of
modern
english
maybe
relevant
in
bbcs
documentary
why
do
we
talk
they
also
discuss
the
forbidden
experiment
and
also
show
how
some
scientists
tried
to
go
around
it
by
depriving
male
songbirds
of
their
environment
they
found
that
birdsongdeprived
songbirds
were
unable
to
perform
their
mating
songs
after
some
generations
they
developed
a
mating
song
again
in
a
certain
sense
i
havent
grown
up
yet
so
i
still
can
say
it
and
i
will
in
chinese
a
tonal
language
its
impossible
to
ask
a
question
through
use
of
tone
in
voice
and
so
questions
end
in
ma
to
signify
that
they
are
indeed
questions
though
in
modern
chinese
writing
i
do
believe
they
use
question
marks
in
addition
to
the
ma
particle
edit
as
said
best
below
me
it
is
possible
to
ask
a
question
through
tone
in
chinese
the
more
you
know
im
not
saying
that
none
of
the
skills
involved
will
be
applicable
or
related
to
the
work
of
a
n
academic
linguist
but
this
job
and
most
cia
fbi
nsa
and
other
governmental
jobs
looking
for
linguists
sounds
like
its
looking
for
a
cryptologist
data
analyst
information
systems
analyst
this
stuff
is
cool
and
interesting
and
helps
the
militarygovernment
but
isnt
really
to
do
with
studying
and
deciphering
the
patterns
of
natural
language
some
other
government
jobs
that
look
for
linguists
look
for
translators
but
this
isnt
that
either
and
by
data
i
dont
mean
linguistic
data
actually
theyre
not
it
may
be
that
my
vowels
are
more
similar
to
the
greater
new
york
city
region
as
im
from
western
ma
maybe
there
are
just
a
lot
of
people
from
that
region
that
move
to
boston
but
i
most
certainly
ran
into
it
quite
a
lot
there
as
well
would
you
prefer
the
case
endings
in
latin
or
the
endless
inflections
that
the
chinese
rely
on
or
would
you
rather
memorize
a
short
list
of
exceptions
and
irregularities
what
is
this
i
dont
even
for
future
reference
if
you
have
a
question
about
flair
please
message
the
mods
different
kinds
of
change
can
be
called
different
things
as
others
said
clipping
lenition
etc
but
one
that
hasnt
been
mentioned
is
grammaticalization
which
produces
things
like
i
am
going
to
im
gonna
imma
no
worries
the
s
in
the
example
marys
leaving
is
an
example
of
an
enclitic
so
the
s
functions
like
the
to
be
verb
except
that
its
pronunciation
depends
on
the
environment
in
which
it
is
placed
which
is
the
definition
of
a
clitic
actually
thats
true
thats
what
he
wrote
but
i
think
he
meant
to
say
that
ll
was
pronounced
the
same
as
y
i
get
where
youre
coming
from
though
uga
has
a
fairly
well
established
ling
program
its
been
hit
a
bit
by
budget
cuts
recently
but
close
to
tenn
offer
langacq
classes
grad
advisor
for
the
program
focuses
in
this
area
but
he
can
be
interesting
to
work
with
and
they
just
got
a
grant
34
years
ago
for
a
bunch
of
new
neuroling
equipment
might
tailor
into
your
psyc
ling
interest
also
the
psyc
department
there
is
hugh
so
it
would
be
easy
to
double
major
or
do
like
i
did
and
minor
in
tesol
to
get
the
sla
theory
and
practical
experience
pm
if
you
have
any
qiestions
hmm
yes
and
no
im
neither
a
native
spanish
speaker
nor
from
south
america
but
have
been
asked
frequently
if
im
from
either
argentina
or
venezuela
occasionally
ill
be
asked
if
im
from
guatemala
or
ecuador
but
argentina
and
venezuela
are
the
two
i
get
asked
most
often
its
almost
as
if
i
have
to
be
one
or
the
other
oddly
enough
mexican
spanish
is
what
im
surrounded
by
theyre
both
english
now
baby
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
languages
are
equally
complex
the
svo
word
order
applies
in
all
cases
one
rule
the
alternative
is
a
welter
of
word
endings
often
depending
on
spelling
gender
of
each
word
many
rules
surely
the
number
of
rules
required
to
define
a
system
is
a
valid
measure
of
complexity
very
analytic
does
not
mean
less
grammar
it
means
word
order
is
more
important
than
in
heavily
inflected
language
the
interval
is
consonant
you
dont
get
it
do
you
the
usage
of
stem
as
quoted
above
was
a
way
of
shaming
people
of
that
background
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
dont
feel
stemmajors
are
oppressed
enough
you
dont
have
the
right
to
turn
anyones
social
background
into
a
perjorative
just
because
people
like
them
are
not
oppressed
enough
as
a
group
i
have
no
idea
how
you
can
somehow
justify
allowing
slurs
for
people
that
you
just
dont
see
as
being
oppressed
enough
that
is
a
twisted
unethical
system
of
judgment
you
are
using
to
justify
blatantly
disrespectful
behavior
towards
others
one
step
further
among
americans
its
usually
h
even
more
than
x
i
think
maybe
we
can
pay
neil
degrasse
tyson
to
say
it
that
or
zombie
carl
sagan
so
braveramazing2
interesting
its
like
the
least
i
understand
the
language
as
it
evolves
the
more
decidedly
germanic
it
sounds
my
native
language
finnish
is
not
even
in
the
same
family
as
english
so
i
dont
think
we
can
compare
much
no
thats
perfect
i
want
to
see
whether
this
pattern
is
the
product
of
some
sort
of
idiosyncrasy
in
the
language
like
some
idioms
or
motivated
by
something
deeper
and
more
semantic
ah
okay
so
saying
he
pissed
his
pants
to
you
would
be
a
bit
like
saying
he
pissed
his
own
pants
to
me
i
find
it
strange
that
english
doesnt
match
that
in
welsh
moron
means
carrot
l
i
speak
a
pretty
distinct
inner
western
norwegian
dialect
i
see
the
dialect
becoming
thinner
and
thinner
with
people
swapping
old
dialect
words
out
with
bokml
oslo
odda
dialect
closest
town
or
bergen
dialect
closest
city
for
example
the
standard
norwegian
bokml
word
for
us
is
oss
but
in
my
dialect
we
say
aoko
ours
in
bokml
is
vr
while
we
say
aokans
lately
its
becoming
more
common
for
the
younger
people
here
to
use
the
bokml
words
also
the
word
for
become
we
say
verta
but
its
slowly
being
replaced
with
the
bokml
version
bli
but
the
most
distinct
change
is
how
almost
everyone
below
the
age
of
30
has
changed
the
ao
diphthong
with
a
simple
myself
included
baot
is
now
bt
vaor
is
vr
and
saor
is
sr
to
name
some
examples
meaning
boat
spring
and
wound
i
think
ao
will
be
completely
gone
in
4050
years
or
so
these
types
of
changes
are
happening
all
over
norway
the
local
dialects
start
to
disappear
and
merge
into
eachother
the
reason
is
that
people
are
more
mobile
and
most
of
the
media
uses
bokml
which
is
very
different
from
some
dialects
oh
whoa
this
is
a
shame
i
ran
across
this
post
while
looking
for
threads
for
this
same
question
currently
on
the
frontpagea
good
discussion
of
whats
going
on
and
where
it
occurs
can
be
found
here
but
basically
this
is
the
deal
the
ame
r
sound
is
usually
palatal
andor
retroflex
t
and
d
and
s
for
some
people
get
palatalized
edit
or
retroflexed
just
like
english
tj
dj
and
sj
i
know
nothing
about
the
other
phenomenon
youre
talking
about
although
after
muttering
under
my
breath
for
a
minute
im
almost
wondering
if
its
something
like
this
since
r
which
is
along
with
the
alveolar
flap
often
the
pronunciation
of
the
r
in
a
lot
of
languages
other
than
english
is
alveolar
i
think
it
might
be
possible
that
for
a
lot
of
speakers
the
t
becomes
dental
to
make
it
easier
to
follow
with
an
alveolar
sound
without
a
gap
between
them
and
from
there
for
some
speakers
it
might
become
something
like
r
since
most
american
english
dialects
dont
have
dental
stops
proper
if
the
voicing
is
really
happening
it
could
be
because
r
is
voiced
although
it
feels
a
little
odd
in
that
situation
but
like
i
said
this
is
not
something
i
know
a
lot
about
this
just
needs
a
better
answer
than
downvotion
all
that
said
im
sorry
you
got
downvoted
the
only
reason
i
could
imagine
why
is
that
some
people
get
really
upset
when
something
perceived
as
a
repost
appears
and
i
get
that
but
at
the
same
time
this
is
in
the
end
a
dynamic
community
and
reposts
both
for
karmas
sake
and
because
people
forgetor
arent
sure
howto
check
the
subs
history
for
the
topic
simply
do
happen
even
in
that
case
the
repeat
should
get
a
reference
back
to
the
older
postsand
sometimes
a
topic
feels
slightly
different
from
the
old
ones
as
with
the
ame
substitution
question
you
had
rant
its
late
no
local
dialect
is
proper
high
german
ah
interesting
fillers
that
are
not
really
translatable
such
as
would
slurred
speech
really
be
called
an
accent
heres
my
thesis
on
lexeme
categorization
in
creole
languages
it
may
not
be
directly
relevant
to
what
you
want
to
do
but
you
can
definitely
find
some
sources
which
discuss
the
subject
in
further
detail
youre
of
course
welcome
to
cite
some
of
my
brilliant
insights
xd
edit
it
seems
to
be
directly
relevant
at
least
the
first
part
awesomesauce
i
love
it
when
people
read
my
stuff
xd
thanks
also
for
reference
it
would
be
help
knowing
who
you
studied
under
goatgreatest
of
all
time
persian
has
one
vestige
of
the
case
system
r
the
accusative
marker
however
it
only
applies
in
specific
cases
which
i
cant
really
explain
very
interesting
thats
exactly
what
im
looking
for
oed
has
ignoring
anything
with
accent
marks
or
other
indications
in
the
spelling
indicating
the
word
is
clearly
still
thought
of
as
a
borrowing
aboard
afront
bongre
meaning
with
good
will
contrary
counter
enter
meaning
between
marked
as
obs
environ
maugre
moyenant
nonobstant
opposite
pending
and
per
most
of
these
have
first
attestations
between
1200
and
1400
sure
but
thats
not
quite
what
op
was
asking
those
characters
are
pronouncable
without
a
sentencelevel
or
discourselevel
classifier
as
in
musical
notation
they
are
characterlevel
classifiers
but
probably
best
considered
part
of
the
written
letter
as
they
dont
predictably
inform
the
phonetic
content
of
the
sign
ditto
wow
i
just
got
the
joke
about
the
robot
dog
k9
in
doctor
who
oo
wow
thank
you
for
all
that
science
you
just
dropped
on
me
are
there
more
versions
of
llamas
with
hats
as
a
neverpat
ex
pat
but
never
lived
there
this
was
genius
in
some
languages
such
as
russian
its
actually
a
grammatical
error
not
to
use
double
negatives
haitian
creole
is
usually
considered
to
have
three
determined
by
syntactic
constraints
wikipedia
has
a
good
overview
i
cant
find
a
better
source
quickly
i
liked
this
article
it
wasnt
embarrassingly
condescending
and
i
learned
a
little
from
it
i
am
so
going
to
use
tht
in
shorthand
handwritten
notes
i
dont
speak
arabic
but
ive
seen
this
a
lot
when
arabic
speakers
write
using
the
latin
alphabet
they
use
numbers
to
represent
the
letters
that
we
dont
have
in
our
alphabet
does
that
make
sense
blust
2009
also
includes
descriptions
of
counting
in
austronesian
languages
one
language
cant
remember
which
had
a
particularly
evocative
phrase
for
15
two
arms
and
a
leg
have
died
that
makes
sense
cool
those
arent
really
neologisms
though
just
sounds
they
dont
describe
anything
theyre
just
used
for
effect
i
agree
with
hurrayforzacs
post
to
an
extent
but
even
the
bill
cosby
thing
isnt
really
a
catchphrase
i
think
what
op
is
really
looking
for
is
gibberish
kind
of
looks
mongolian
joke
referencing
graffiti
on
a
historical
stone
for
those
that
dont
know
nearly
all
of
these
words
evolved
from
protoindoeuropean
kos
which
meant
whowhatwhich
the
differences
in
the
endings
have
to
do
with
declension
i
suspect
that
the
fact
that
why
is
gets
pronounced
whys
makes
the
analogy
much
easier
to
form
in
arabic
its
sitta
except
for
when
in
an
ordinal
form
saadis
and
is
the
only
number
to
diverge
from
its
regular
form
so
much
when
it
becomes
ordinal
so
thats
there
too
those
letters
are
arguably
the
kind
of
thing
in
which
hed
be
unlikely
to
thou
the
addressee
and
then
theres
the
potential
effect
of
scribal
polishing
plural
you
started
spreading
centuries
before
thou
became
moribund
iirc
you
can
find
it
in
chaucer
if
we
knew
which
pronoun
he
used
to
yell
at
underlings
now
my
favourite
thing
about
numbers
around
the
world
is
that
so
many
of
the
first
three
are
made
up
of
the
right
number
of
lines
normally
horizontal
in
our
numbers
for
example
we
join
them
up
with
a
quick
curving
squiggle
between
them
in
2
and
3
and
1
has
obviously
been
flipped
my
suspicion
in
this
is
that
it
depends
on
when
the
orthography
was
established
the
longer
ago
the
spelling
rules
were
created
the
more
out
of
synch
they
are
with
spoken
language
and
when
you
have
distinct
regional
variations
as
you
mention
with
the
contrast
between
argentinian
and
spanish
the
rules
become
even
less
reflective
of
pronunciation
english
is
a
special
case
though
because
weve
taken
so
many
words
from
so
many
languages
and
havent
followed
any
sort
of
strict
rules
when
we
took
them
yes
but
language
as
a
capacity
not
any
given
language
or
grammar
youve
misunderstood
pinker
are
you
a
douchebag
its
the
germanic
substrate
hypothesis
unfortunately
even
the
degree
to
which
germanic
was
influenced
by
a
substrate
language
is
debated
germanic
is
no
doubt
the
most
radical
branch
of
ie
and
so
ie
etymologies
are
often
murky
a
culturally
very
basic
word
supposedly
without
an
ie
root
may
in
fact
have
one
that
just
isnt
apparent
protobasque
of
some
sort
is
a
very
common
proposal
going
on
the
idea
that
a
basque
language
family
was
spoken
widely
throughout
europe
before
the
indoeuropean
influx
but
theres
no
real
evidence
finnicuralic
is
another
proposal
but
again
its
nothing
but
conjecture
even
etruscan
and
semitic
have
been
proposed
really
just
because
we
know
they
existed
if
its
not
those
then
the
language
would
be
entirely
unattested
outside
of
its
affect
on
germanic
like
numbers
the
masculine
second
person
singular
takes
an
ah
at
the
end
basically
feminine
at
you
sing
masculine
ata
you
sing
thank
you
this
is
what
i
was
hearing
my
roommate
is
both
a
german
and
american
citizen
and
has
never
had
to
decide
for
either
country
german
by
birth
american
through
his
father
because
latin
speakers
thought
men
were
better
i
thought
that
was
rather
because
the
indoeuropean
gender
systems
were
largely
inherited
from
protoindoeuropean
which
started
out
as
having
only
animate
and
inanimate
and
later
had
a
splinter
group
of
inanimate
nouns
whose
stems
ended
in
a
laryngeal
be
generalised
as
feminine
those
guys
were
the
real
patriarchal
ones
with
women
relegated
to
the
status
of
things
at
least
linguistically
but
probably
also
socially
the
position
of
women
in
roman
times
to
be
sure
was
not
stellar
but
given
that
at
least
slavic
languages
have
the
same
phenomenon
and
were
in
no
way
descended
from
latin
i
tend
to
think
the
whole
thing
is
a
bit
more
widespread
and
has
a
cause
that
comes
from
a
somewhat
more
distant
past
than
avgvstvs
btw
theres
a
documentary
on
netflix
right
now
called
through
deaf
eyes
all
about
deaf
peoplelifeculture
in
america
i
just
studied
in
chile
and
my
host
brother
couldnt
either
and
he
got
made
fun
of
too
nice
username
had
me
legitimately
excited
for
a
minute
its
found
in
lots
of
places
but
mostly
among
uneducated
people
i
always
thought
it
was
a
form
of
voseo
since
ive
only
heard
it
with
voseantes
do
they
also
say
vos
instead
of
t
i
heard
lenin
was
known
for
using
the
french
r
dont
know
if
it
was
a
speech
defect
or
him
putting
on
airs
from
time
spent
abroad
puerto
ricans
also
dont
roll
their
rs
and
everyone
else
makes
fun
of
them
its
mentioned
at
the
bottom
of
this
page
its
not
really
a
conclusive
answer
though
it
just
says
that
its
a
dialect
singular
form
also
venites
and
queres
not
the
same
as
rioplatense
quers
i
think
most
dialects
are
stronger
in
rural
areas
i
used
to
blame
that
on
lack
of
outside
influence
but
since
cable
television
has
existed
for
over
thirty
years
i
dont
think
that
works
anymore
also
the
whole
great
lakes
vowel
shift
thing
messes
up
the
outsidethemedia
thing
too
but
still
dialects
seem
to
last
longer
when
theyre
further
from
cities
lots
of
cable
tv
or
not
i
watched
we
still
live
here
in
a
sociolinguistics
class
its
pretty
light
on
nutsandbolts
linguistics
content
but
gives
a
good
idea
of
what
language
revitalization
can
mean
to
a
community
of
speakers
interesting
what
about
other
v
sentences
can
you
think
of
any
that
would
feel
more
native
eg
or
maybe
anyway
should
exist
in
cantonese
in
some
form
since
its
an
older
word
and
covered
as
iaoiuew
ending
in
older
premandarin
phonologies
i
think
it
shouldnt
be
simply
a
borrowing
or
simplification
of
ill
have
to
get
back
to
you
on
this
one
after
i
ask
someone
with
more
cantonese
expertise
were
rather
okay
with
using
whatever
homophones
we
can
think
of
to
transcribe
things
this
isnt
just
true
in
cantonese
most
nonmandarin
languagesdialects
have
to
do
this
since
few
ever
had
proper
written
forms
too
bad
if
you
ask
me
id
love
to
see
a
larger
collection
of
cantonese
or
hakka
written
works
edit
i
talked
to
a
friend
whos
more
knowledgable
about
cantonese
he
pointed
me
to
the
phrase
bai6
gaa1
leu1
which
has
with
the
older
mean
of
to
finish
the
same
as
liu5
leu1
in
this
case
is
just
an
alternative
pronunciation
of
which
there
a
more
than
a
few
in
cantonese
theres
also
this
page
which
covers
words
containing
but
as
you
can
see
a
number
are
using
it
as
the
le
particle
while
others
are
strictly
idiomatic
liu5
you
linked
to
the
wrong
comment
to
be
able
to
understand
the
phenomenon
the
top
comment
of
that
thread
shows
that
on
was
the
unstressed
variant
of
another
preposition
an
over
time
this
unstressed
variant
was
used
exclusively
with
certain
classes
of
words
and
thereby
split
from
the
other
variants
of
an
in
general
conscious
language
changes
rarely
appear
sometimes
prescriptivist
bugaboos
can
spread
widely
enough
to
take
hold
and
really
change
things
such
as
the
elimination
of
negative
concord
commonly
known
as
double
negatives
from
many
varieties
of
english
but
all
language
changes
are
viral
in
some
respect
since
they
spread
across
the
community
it
does
not
need
to
be
conscious
to
do
this
to
my
mind
there
are
three
main
forces
at
work
in
language
production
acquisition
accommodation
and
activation
acquisition
is
internalizing
the
rules
and
properties
of
a
target
variety
accommodation
is
speaking
in
a
way
that
is
either
more
like
your
interlocutors
way
of
speaking
or
that
you
expect
will
be
more
easily
understood
by
them
activation
is
the
readying
of
language
features
in
the
mind
to
put
them
into
sentences
language
changes
spread
because
people
use
the
new
forms
more
they
might
use
them
more
because
they
recently
heard
them
so
they
are
activated
in
their
minds
or
primed
they
might
use
them
more
because
those
forms
most
closely
match
the
conceptsfeelingsstructures
in
their
minds
they
might
use
them
more
because
they
are
accommodating
other
people
who
use
them
more
or
they
might
use
them
more
because
theyre
so
common
that
they
essentially
constitute
the
dominant
target
to
be
acquired
and
are
therefore
the
new
normal
theres
no
external
way
to
tell
at
any
given
moment
which
forces
are
at
work
and
theres
no
reason
why
these
three
things
should
be
considered
mutually
exclusive
but
theyre
also
not
generally
conscious
mechanisms
why
was
the
post
removed
i
think
it
could
be
comparable
to
learning
danish
when
you
speak
fluent
english
really
you
make
an
asinine
assumption
of
intent
and
somehow
were
playing
a
game
someone
needs
his
nap
theyll
be
more
similar
overall
but
were
still
talking
about
different
language
branches
it
comes
down
to
this
old
english
and
old
norse
could
have
possibly
been
mutually
intelligible
iff
west
germanic
was
mutually
intelligible
with
north
germanic
im
not
sure
that
was
the
case
if
so
wed
still
need
evidence
for
the
mutual
intelligibility
of
norse
and
english
overall
my
point
is
that
it
would
seem
quite
difficult
to
yield
mutual
intelligibility
from
contact
at
least
insofar
as
the
dane
law
situation
was
concerned
there
can
be
parallels
similarities
etc
but
quite
a
bit
of
it
is
needed
to
be
intelligible
more
than
is
realistic
if
those
languages
were
already
too
diverged
take
a
look
at
these
excerpts
from

similar
sure
but
there
are
a
great
many
differences
morphosyntactically
not
to
mention
lexical
differences
i
dont
see
this
being
mutually
intelligible
at
all
this
seems
similar
to
the
notion
that
texting
language
and
word
abbreviations
are
going
to
kill
english
people
have
been
using
short
cuts
and
abbreviations
for
centuries
in
english
in
notes
letters
etc
it
is
a
flawed
logic
one
assumes
without
a
savvy
understanding
of
historical
evidence
yup
i
didnt
interpret
it
as
outright
denial
nor
accusation
just
an
unconscious
habit
of
projection
along
with
some
unquestioned
assumptions
about
others
too
probably
when
they
have
to
consciously
speak
in
the
first
person
its
quite
difficult
for
most
of
them
often
theyll
tell
me
that
it
does
make
a
difference
in
how
they
perceive
themselves
and
others
when
they
own
their
own
thoughtsfeelingsactions
using
i
i
feel
like
noam
chomsky
and
steven
pinker
are
definitely
more
well
known
poplinguists
though
i
guess
chomsky
never
wrote
anything
too
mainstream
and
pinker
is
technically
a
cognitive
behavioral
psychologist
but
a
lot
of
pinkers
books
could
be
classified
as
pop
linguistic
im
not
sure
maybe
because
its
an
actual
curse
to
condemn
something
to
hell
but
it
depends
on
the
context
there
are
many
uses
of
damn
which
are
acceptable
in
polite
conversation
but
as
an
expletive
it
seems
harsh
you
dont
want
your
small
children
saying
damn
or
even
crap
on
american
tv
the
word
god
is
routinely
silenced
when
people
say
goddamn
i
guess
when
my
child
was
small
i
would
say
darn
and
then
when
she
was
closer
to
being
a
teenager
i
started
allowing
myself
to
say
crap
i
remember
when
she
started
saying
crap
and
i
thought
it
sounded
kind
of
funny
coming
out
of
her
mouth
but
acceptable
because
she
was
of
an
age
where
she
knew
to
use
it
sparingly
and
meaningfully
even
now
as
a
young
woman
when
shes
with
me
she
says
gosh
and
crap
instead
of
fuck
and
shit
curse
words
are
a
necessary
part
of
life
and
i
believe
people
protect
and
nurture
them
so
they
will
maintain
their
power
most
people
grow
up
learning
the
rules
of
cursing
through
context
and
practice
much
the
same
as
they
learn
the
finer
points
of
colloquial
usage
and
even
grammar
and
vocabulary
to
a
large
extent
so
i
think
in
the
end
considering
damn
as
a
bad
word
comes
down
mostly
to
social
norms
its
bad
because
people
want
it
to
be
bad
post
great
vowel
shift
english
pronunciation
changed
drastically
while
scholars
have
a
pretty
thorough
understanding
of
these
changes
id
wager
that
communication
between
a
chaucerian
and
someone
contemporary
would
be
fraught
with
misunderstandings
because
of
the
gvs
i
always
find
it
much
easier
to
read
chaucer
or
julian
of
norwich
the
pearl
poet
gower
langland
etc
than
actually
decipher
the
audio
its
not
any
more
constructed
than
modern
english
is
is
it
just
standardized
the
point
is
what
occurs
as
this
is
lost
over
time
and
that
usually
tends
to
trend
toward
greater
use
of
the
accusative
over
the
nominative
and
not
viceversa
when
a
nominativeaccusative
system
is
the
one
being
lost
oh
that
i
agree
with
old
new
certainly
seems
to
be
a
pattern
of
linear
ordering
in
and
of
itself
to
me
how
is
it
not
im
not
trying
to
discredit
greenbergs
universals
here
im
merely
pointing
out
that
theres
a
whole
lot
of
unscientific
data
massaging
and
cherrypicking
going
on
when
trying
to
fit
the
edge
cases
into
the
arbitrary
typological
straitjacket
that
makes
the
theory
effectively
unfalsifiable
so
yeah
basically
ug
is
shorthand
for
describing
universal
syntactic
and
linguistic
tendencies
in
natural
language
nothing
more
it
may
very
well
be
better
attributed
to
other
cognitive
powers
but
until
theres
some
good
reason
to
say
so
i
dont
think
it
quite
matters
i
mean
it
kind
of
does
matter
because
by
chomskys
own
admission
that
formulation
of
ug
is
trivial
and
pretty
much
every
serious
linguist
accepts
that
there
is
something
special
that
lets
humans
learn
language
but
not
kittens
at
least
ive
never
heard
of
someone
who
doesnt
its
true
that
stigmatized
accents
tend
to
be
associated
with
stigmatized
social
groups
you
say
this
and
get
5
karma
i
point
out
why
the
south
is
stigmatized
and
get
9
curious
yet
that
again
starts
from
the
assumption
that
questions
are
formed
from
statements
and
processed
by
reverting
back
to
statements
there
is
nothing
to
explain
if
you
drop
that
assumption
as
parsing
the
question
directly
needs
just
a
few
easily
learnable
rules
im
not
making
any
assumptions
about
transformations
the
underscores
in
23a
and
23b
indicate
something
about
the
interpretation
of
can
nothing
more
generative
grammar
isnt
a
theory
of
processing
its
a
theory
of
linguistic
knowledge
or
competence
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
can
in
23
can
only
be
interpreted
as
it
is
in
23b
where
it
says
something
about
the
ability
to
eat
if
you
can
provide
a
few
easily
learnable
rules
that
will
produce
all
and
only
the
correct
interpretations
for
this
example
and
even
a
sizable
subset
of
the
other
examples
in
berwick
et
al
more
power
to
you
youll
pardon
me
if
i
dont
hold
my
breath
while
i
wait
i
already
gave
you
one
i
must
have
missed
it
there
is
no
constrained
homophony
without
ug
i
disagree
read
or
reread
the
berwick
et
al
paper
they
present
a
number
of
examples
of
ugfree
facts
about
constrained
homophony
they
use
these
to
motivate
the
need
for
ug
but
they
describe
the
relevant
facts
without
invoking
ug
they
also
show
how
at
least
one
example
of
a
simple
rule
fails
to
account
for
the
relevant
facts
for
what
its
worth
ill
be
frank
im
a
phonology
person
not
a
syntax
one
and
bayesian
learning
works
quite
well
for
a
lot
of
problems
in
phonology
most
of
that
article
went
over
my
head
though
i
find
it
peculiar
that
you
cite
a
blogpost
criticizing
a
fortyfive
year
old
paper
and
then
saying
bayesianism
doesnt
work
turns
out
it
brought
in
more
discussion
than
i
thought
it
would
i
was
just
asking
to
see
if
anyone
knew
anything
about
it
haha
fixed
knew
that
actually
not
sure
why
the
typing
didnt
display
that
cheers
hey
functionalists
why
are
you
all
so
stupid

wrong

why
are
you
so

searching

i
dont

there
is
as
much

as
people
like
to

yes
this

are

reasons
to

another

with

you

not

considering

this
is

to
me
hungary
and
croatia
are
right
next
to

and
my
professor
of
magyarul
a
magyar
claims
that
for
4
words
in
croatian
there
is

in
hungarian
and
their
linguists
are
still
arguing
wether
they
have
rules
cases
nominativus
genitivus
etc
or
just
pile
words
the
way
they
like
it
i
started
typing
up
a
long
post
about
why
i
disagree
about
your
professors
arguments
mostly
because
while
some
disputes
have
been
brought
up
they
have
been
refuted
by
most
linguists
and
hungarian
remains
classified
as
finnougric
part
of
the
uralic
family
and
most
linguists
still
consider
agglutinative
endings
as
cases
even
though
they
are
more
individual
than
fusional
language
inflections
it
then
went
to
word
borrowing
vs
grammar
borrowing
border
areas
and
the
treaty
of
trianon
then
i
realized
i
was
starting
to
sound
like
a
pompous
ass
especially
arguing
with
your
language
professor
who
is
not
wrong
that
there
is
some
argument
about
these
things
and
most
likely
has
a
degree
in
something
i
just
study
because
im
strangely
fascinated
by
it
so
i
got
rid
of
most
of
that
i
do
want
to
say
though
that
im
not
insulted
even
if
i
were
hungarian
id
have
no
reason
to
be
some
papers
that
might

i
got
accepted
into
georgetown
but
went
elsewhere
instead
you
should
be
careful
selecting
your
program
since
there
isnt
a
lot
you
can
do
with
a
masters
in
linguistics
additionally
the
funding
that
is
there
is
primarily
for
phd
students
when
i
asked
georgetown
about
this
they
basically
said
that
the
only
form
of
financial
help
i
could
get
was
in
the
form
of
loans
the
program
i
chose
told
me
that
while
they
dont
officially
offer
any
funding
the
masters
students
usually
find
something
to
help
i
was
there
for
two
years
and
had
funding
every
quarter
as
far
as
the
program
goes
you
want
to
look
for
something
that
suits
you
personally
its
less
of
a
big
deal
for
a
masters
candidate
but
you
should
be
looking
at
the
faculty
and
finding
people
you
want
to
work
with
who
are
doing
things
youre
interested
in
it
started
as
this
stupid
thing
for
rage
comics
from
here
then
started
using
le
as
a
trend
for
rage
comics
because
it
was
funny
to
them
the
mods
ended
up
banning
it
i
think
because
of
the
large
amount
of
people
complaining
about
the
usage
of
le
in
rage
comics
rcirclejerk
made
fun
of
it
and
over
time
le
as
with
the

dae
have
become
more
associated
with

rather
than

endothermic
reaction
but
not
the
endothermic
big
reaction
can
you
say
the
endothermic
big
reaction
when
intending
to
say
an
reaction
that
endothermic
and
big
2
assuming
the
endothermic
big
reaction
is
marked
why
is
it
marked
what
distinguishes
between
endothermic
and
big
so
that
endothermic
follows
big
and
not
the
other
way
round
3
note
that
endothermic
allows
np
deletion
while
big
does
not
4
i
am
hypothesizing
that
a
there
is
a
semantic
distinction
between
endothermic
and
big
that
has
syntactic
implications
namely
b
ordering
and
c
np
deletion
the
poor

and
the
sick
in
english
are
acceptable
as
opposed
to
the

because

theres

think
who
talks
a
lot
about
the
parallels
between
albanian
and
romanian
marginalized
by
linguists
up
to
now
as
they
always
stressed
the
latinness
of
romanian
apparently
a
lot
of
latin
words
had
similar
evolutions
in
both
languages
and
the
form
of
some
latin
words
can
only
be
explained
via
an
intermediate
protoalbanian
faze
which
is
to
mean
that
dacian
and
protoalbanian
were
related
but
dacian
was
almost
totally
latinized

text

the
suffix
ling
does
exist
in
german
however
it
is
in
my
opinion
not
a
standard
diminutive
suffix
in
its
narrower
sense
but
has
more
often
a
pejorative
to
neutral
meaning

latin
is
similar
to
pie
how
i
mean
its
closer
to
pie
than
the
romance
languages
are
today
naturally
but
i
thought
the
closest
attested
language
to
pie
was
vedic
sanskrit
which
is
much
older
than
latin
in
which
dialect
would
you
do
that
its
the
absence
of
elephants
all
the
way
down
slightly
more
seriously
if
big
if
one
can
get
an
ai
program
to
pass
a
turing
test
itll
be
very
hard
to
argue
that
meaning
cant
be
in
a
system
of
oppositions
in
terms
of
what
humans
actually
do
i
dont
understand
current
thinking
on
neural
processing
well
enough
to
know
whether
it
is
modelable
well
by
titanic
networks
of
onoff
nodes
etc
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
still
philosophers
and
people
in
cogsci
going
back
and
forth
over
the
subject
so
my
policy
is
to
nod
a
lot
and
look
interested
what
do
current
generative
approaches
do
i
assume
the
meaning
is
separate
from
the
grammar
but
what
form
does
it
take
and
what
is
that
taken
to
be
an
abstraction
from
my
aunt
is
from
the
lebanon
and
therefore
speaks
fluent
arabic
in
the
lebanese
dialect
and
she
said
that
most
arabs
speak
their
local
dialect
which
can
vary
a
lot
and
the
egyptian
dialect
since
egyptians
make
the
most
arab
films
that
said
she
wasnt
there
in
a
long
time
dubai
basically
exploded
after
she
left
the
arabic
world
and
that
pretty
much
excludes
poor
villagers
since
they
most
likely
dont
have
the
ability
to
watch
films
orthographic
normalization
is
pretty
useful
for
language
revitalization
i
see
where
youre
coming
from
but
we
oppose
linguistic
discrimination
not
simply
anything
orthographic
well
in
german
the
preference
for
simple
past
vs
present
perfect
is
a
little
regional
and
a
little
context
based
the
simple
past
is
preferred
for
writing
and
especially
academic
writings
for
a
lot
of
german
speakers
the
present
perfect
is
more
friendly
so
its
preferred
for
spoken
language
in
southern
german
speaking
areas
bavaria
switzerland
etc
this
is
definitely
the
case
even
though
there
are
a
number
of
verbs
that
are
basically
only
used
in
the
simple
past
in
spoken
speech
down
there
in
the
northern
areas
the
classcontext
differences
and
connotations
arent
as
strong
but
formal
writing
still
uses
a
lot
simple
past
actually
people
talk
about
a
southeast

suggests
that
there
are

generally

speaking
to
recent
immigrants
in

really
helps
to
open
doors
because
it
makes
them
feel
accepted
in
a
foreign
land
where
they
can
often
feel
misunderstood
and
homesick
its
a
pretty
friendly
gesture
to
make
that

imagine
i
came
down
from
canada
where
i
live
to
southern
california
where
you
live
and
said
things
like
holla
its
hella
hot
down
here
you
probably
dont
talk
like
that
and
it
would
be
incredibly
presumptuous
and
rude
of
me
to
expect
that
you
speak
so
stereotypically
based
on
where
you
live
not
only
that
but
it
would
be
objectification
and
misappropriation
as
i
try

assume
a
cultural

pattern
that
is
not
my
own
just
to
try
to
appeal
to
you
language
isnt
indicative
of
culture
but
dialect
is
its
one
thing
to
learn
to
speak
english
as
a
second
language
but
its
another
thing
to
try
to
speak
cockney
when
youre
not
from
london
besides
any
time
you
try
to
speak
in
somebody
elses
accent
whether
its
cockney
or
ebonics
you
will
always
sound
like
youre
mocking
them
tldr
speaking
spanish
with
the
hispanic
immigrants
around
you
is
friendly
calling
them
homey
is
not
im
not
that
surprised
really
these

look
young
maybe
even

i
am
most
likely
wrong

edit
university
thanks
i
dont
have
time
for
a
full
reply
to
op
but
i
want
to
correct
some
misinterpretation
here
op
is
not
asking
about
haitian
french
a
dialect
of
french
spoken
by
about
15
of
the
haitian
population
she
is
asking
about
haitian
creole
a
different
language
that
has
been
largely
restructured
when
compared
to
french
haitian
creole
lacks
many
of
the
features
of
french
such
as
morphological
paradigms
frontrounded
vowels
agreement
overt
case
marking
in
pronouns
gender
dpinitial
definite
determiners
and
more
haitian
creole
is
not
a
dialect
of
french
nor
can
you
compare
the
slight
differences
between
caribbean
spanish
and
the
standard
spanishes
of
the
americas
with
or
the
portuguese
varieties
of
brazil
vs
portugal
with
the
differences
between
haitian
creole
and
french
under
no
circumstances
is
haitian
creole
mutually
intelligible
with
french
moreover
you
misrepresent
the
amount
of
time
that
the
french
were
in
haiti
as
they
had
settlements
in
the
early
17th
century
and
had
official
control
of
haiti
from
16971801
with
continuing
french
influence
even
after
independence
when
french
was
the
only
official
language
the
spanish
never
set
up
plantations
in
haiti
like
the
french
had
where
the
slaves
developed
their
creole
to
me
it
seems
that
only
older
people
who
went
to
isolated
or
private
schools
acquired
geaffecteerde
spraaklike
my
grandmother
and
the
queen
who
were
educated
mostly
in
a
private
setting
in
small
communities
or
overseasin
the
20th
century
both
accent
appear
to
have
been
heavily
influenced
by
french
and
englishas
these
people
mostly
spoke
french
amongst
eachother
dutch
was
only
used
to
adress
the
staff
geaffecteerde
spraak
seems
like
its
more
similar
to
how
wealthy
people
would
have
spoken
in
first
half
of
the
19th
century
while
bekakt
haags
might
have
been
less
isolated
from
vernacular
haagshollandic
im
not
a
linguist
at
all
so
this
is
just
speculation
the
wiki
doesnt
offer
a
lot
of
info
on
the
history
of
either
accent
one
thing
the
wiki
mentions
is
the
use
of
specific
words
like
pleeloo
or
wc
instead
of
toilet
and
ijskasticebox
instead
of
koelkastrefrigerator
that
does
still
happen
and
is
reinforced
at
societies
like
the
student
corporations
as
in
say
it
wrong
and
you
will
be
mocked
and
will
have
to
drink
beer
as
a
punishment
geaffecteerde
spraak
does
come
from
that
area
right
well
i
would
agree
that
it
seems
like
that
however
that
might
just
be
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
most
of
the
rich
people
lived
near
the
hague
or
at
least
spent
a
good
deal
of
their
time
there
during
the
19th
and
early
20th
century
studying
in
leiden
or
delft
making
some
money
in
the
colonies
and
then
working
for
the
government
in
the
hague
was
a
very
typical
career
for
wealthy
young
men
during
that
era
ive
asked
around
how
the
situation
was
for
the
wealthy
families
in
amsterdam
but
no
one
was
able
to
give
any
accurate
descriptions
of
teh
accents
of
their
ancestors
most
of
these
guys
speak
with
a
gooi
accent
or
just
a
amsterdamzuid
accent
nowadayswhich
sound
almost
identical
to
me
i
had
a
teacher
in
high
school
who
did
this
about
10
years
ago
she
was
cajun
though
so
maybe
that
was
part
of
it
im
not
sure
totes
in
other
words
i
dont
really
have
time
to
unravel
the
logical
fallacies
that
make
you
believe
this
is
even
provable
much
less
true
but
you
sound
kind
of
racistclassist
when
you
ask
questions
like
that
also
where
did
you
get
the
time
to
listen
to
500
years
worth
of
native
latin
speakers
of
different
social
classes
no
thats
not
what
i
mean
this
may
be
affected
by
my
native
language
german
but
when
someone
speaks
catalan
in
a
normal
way
ie
not
an
exceptionally
clear
say
professional
speaker
then
this
most
likely
sounds
like
gibberish
to
me
even
though
i
should
understand
some
of
the
words
nowadays
i
am
almost
fluent
in
french
but
it
took
me
much
longer
to
get
out
of
this
gibberish
stage
with
french
than
with
english
my
first
foreign
language
in
part
this
may
be
attributable
to
the
french
fashion
of
speaking
extremely
fast
on
the
other
hand
i
only
know
few
words
each
of
hungarian
and
mandarin
but
when
they
occur
in
a
sentence
in
normal
speech
they
are
so
recognisable
that
often
i
can
guess
the
meaning
of
the
entire
sentence
similarly
with
italian
and
spanish
though
i
know
these
languages
a
bit
better
and
they
have
many
cognates
with
languages
i
know
2
years
of
learning
french
at
school
i
understood
almost
nothing
on
a
french
news
programme
for
beginning
french
learners
on
german
tv
2
weeks
of
casually
using
a
tape
cassette
course
for
italian
i
could
follow
much
of
the
corresponding
programme
for
beginning
italian
learners
ah
yeah
seems
like
common
sense
now
that
i
think
about
it
sconsonant
just
seemed
to
stand
out
to
me
for
some
reason
or
other
thanks
for
your
help
syntax
is
certainly
a
part
of
grammar
as
is
phonology
though
perhaps
less
clearly
in
english
we
have
the
plural
ending
s
as
in
one
car
two
cars
one
cat
two
cats
etc
the
s
ending
in
cars
is
more
of
a
z
sound
while
the
ending
in
cats
is
more
of
an
s
sound
we
also
have
es
for
words
that
end
in
s
like
crosses
if
someone
said
carsss
or
catzzz
it
would
sound
odd
to
an
english
speaker
aave
is
nonrhotic
aave
is
semirhotic
in
some
varieties
though
there
are
varieties
particularly
southern
strains
which
are
nonrhotic
northern
varieties
of
aave
tend
to
keep
the
rhoticity
in
the
vowel
for
bird
where
western
varieties
of
aave
are
fully
rhotic
i
know
they
arent
technical
terms
but
i
could
very
well
imagine
someone
who
doesnt
know
the
technical
terms
or
doesnt
want
to
use
them
saying
hard
and
soft
instead
or
they
werent
really
referring
to
anything
but
wanted
words
that
made
it
sound
like
they
were
referring
to
something
i
shall
call
him
miniminuscule
puts
pinky
into
corner
of
mouth
you
should
modify
it
so
that
people
who
dont
identify
as
either
only
male
or
female
have
a
voice
simple
thing
most
people
screw
up
when
doing
surveys
i
identify
as
male
but
i
know
there
are
those
of
us
here
and
in
general
that
cant
categorize
themselves
so
simply
edit
thank
you
for
the
downvotes
actually
in
switzerland
swiss
german
there
is
are
two
main
words
for
onion
depending
on
the
dialect
one
is
zibele
or
similar
which
is
basicly
zwiebel
but
then
there
is
ble
which
is
for
example
used
in
my
dialect
and
also
means
ball
in
yiddish
theres
a
phrase
gei
kacken
affen
yam
which
literally
means
go
crap
in
the
ocean
it
has
similar
connotations
to
the
english
phrase
go
screw
yourself
excellent
question
im
really
struggling
with
that
level
i
dont
know
much
about
chemistry
so
im
having
to
rely
on
others
who
are
one
expert
suggested
that
the
two
kinds
of
atoms
are
the
ones
from
hydrogen
to
iron
and
then
from
iron
on
up
which
is
generally
a
division
between
atoms
that
have
lower
numbers
of
electrons
and
higher
numbers
and
more
specifically
a
division
between
atoms
that
create
fusion
vs
fission
but
im
wondering
if
its
something
else
that
defines
this
division
maybe
the
stability
of
the
electrons
in
their
shells
i
have
to
do
some
more
work
on
this
level
by
posting
this
here
i
was
hoping
that
others
would
give
me
some
good
criticism
to
help
me
improve
the
map
so
that
its
more
useful
to
everyone
but
what
is
your
position
id
be
surprised
if
it
takes
8
pages
to
say
how
you
would
translate
my
short
example
ps
that
paper
is
impenetrable
very
poorly
put
together
imho
so
i
look
forward
to
your
thoughts
that
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
me
is
the
vowel
you
find
in
of
itself
as
a
stressed
syllable
so
if
anything
id
expect
it
the
other
way
around
i
think
most
students
end
up
being
a
teaching
assistant
while
in
grad
school
alongside
their
own
studies
and
im
not
sure
many
people
work
for
linguistics
departments
doing
research
and
field
work
without
teaching
at
all
but
there
are
classes
in
field
world
and
field
methods
at
least
at
the
graduate
level
that
need
to
be
taught
jobs
like
that
do
exist
now
whether
you
have
much
of
a
chance
at
getting
one
i
cant
say
i
dont
think
the
op
is
talking
about
borrowing
but
i
cant
figure
out
what
theyre
actually
trying
to
ask
doesnt
look
like
any
kind
of
chinese
im
familiar
with
the
rightmost
twothirds
of
this
looks
to
me
like
a
number
0123
a
serial
number
perhaps
good
question
the
coda
consonants
are
normally
bundled
into
a
single
package
for
the
purposes
of
hanging
east
coast
id
say
but
im
also
biased
touch
not
really
the
reason
it
that
the
two
korea
japan
have
taken
different
approaches
to
in
korea
for
example
a
lot
of
words
were
simply
taken
from
the
chinese
and
put
into
korean
there
are
obviously
a
number
of
korean
words
with
no
to
go
with
them
as
opposed
to
bent
etc
and
these
days
more
and
more
people
are
giving
their
children
native
korean
names
korean
adoption
of
sinitic
vocabulary
typically
replaced
the
native
korean
words
in
japan
its
just
one
of
a
few
different
ways
to
read
the
character
goon
is
the
one
thats
likely
to
be
similar
to
korean
and
if
im
not
mistaken
its
usually
only
used
when
a
character
is
part
of
a
compound
but
its
not
consistent
disclosure
i
dont
speak
japanese
that
would
be
to
equate
speaking
properly
with
communicating
better
and
thats
the
position
we
are
against
i
dont
think
you
understand
our
point
here
the
prescriptivists
not
us
think
that
speaking
a
standard
dialect
will
make
you
communicate
better
we
claim
it
does
not
improve
communication
and
so
it
does
not
accomplish
their
goal
maybe
to
help
nonnative
english
speakers
i
imagine
the
meaning
of
those
sentences
could
be
ambiguous
without
the
positivenegative
qualifier
being
highlighted
especially
if
you
are
only
catching
some
of
the
words
i
live
in
a
very
bilingual
area
where
many
people
were
raised
in
both
languages
and
a
lot
of
second
language
speakers
have
nearnative
abilities
if
you
dont
know
what
youre
listening
for
youll
miss
it
but
when
you
spend
a
long
time
around
it
you
start
to
hear
certain
tells
there
are
expressions
that
are
completely
acceptable
in
one
language
in
this
area
that
are
clearly
calqued
from
the
other
language
a
native
speaker
not
raised
in
this
bilingual
setting
would
find
it
very
odd
but
not
incomprehensible
likewise
there
are
certain
phonemes
that
cause
more
trouble
than
others
the
differences
are
still
very
slight
in
these
highproficiency
l2
speakers
but
again
you
can
pick
them
out
if
you
know
what
youre
listening
for
i
imagine
its
even
easier
in
a
lab
setting
with
proper
equipment
no
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
we
use
topdown
linguistic
knowledge
in
order
to
reconstruct
linguistic
stimuli
when
it
has
been
degraded
what
evidence
itt
people
debating
what
an
aural
maths
test
is
is
this
person
serious
oh
that
makes
sense
i
think
thats
what
the
op
is
asking
as
i
said
there
is
very
real
discussion
in
the
literature
over
whether
or
not
there
are
such
things
as
syllabic
consonants
or
whether
they
actually
have
vowels
in
all
or
most
cases
you
know
an
invention
like
smelling
things
or
associating
concepts
with
the

polo
summary
germany
comes
from
germania
the
roman
name
for
the
region
alemania
comes
from
the
alemanni
i
think
some
other
languages
name
germany
after
the
saxons
too
like
how
england
is
named
for
the
angles
the
people
from
anglia
which
is
fun
because
it
means
the
english
region
of
east
anglia
is
to
the
west
of
the
original
anglia
and
deutschland
come
from
an
old
high
german
word
meaning
the
people
or
of
the
people
so
its
like
the
german
peoples
land
oh
i
see
thank
you
that
is
a
thing
that
i
have
never
noticed
before
in
american
accents
but
now
you
point
it
out
it
is
obvious
yet
another
reason
why
a
general
change
in
spelling
for
english
would
be
almost
impossible
how
on
earth
would
we
agree
to
spell
even
these
basic
words
does
anyone
know
if
anyone
has
studied
whether
writing
has
a
measurable
effect
on
language
change
and
changes
in
syntax
more
specifically
it
would
seem
that
it
would
if
older
texts
have
a
prominent
role
in
society
they
would
slow
language
change
as
speakers
would
keep
their
speech
relatively
closer
to
prestigious
registers
used
in
the
texts
this
would
be
a
hard
hypothesis
to
test
how
could
you
compare
how
a
nonliterate
language
has
changed
over
a
long
period
of
time
what
is
meant
by
there
is
no
plosive
in
expresso
currently
my
main
focus
is
case
assignment
there
are
two
hot
debates
going
on
with
regards
to
case
in
generative
linguistics
the
first
is
how
case
is
assigned
the
two
competing
ideas
are
that
it
is
assigned
via
agree
eg
chomsky
2000
2001
or
via
relative
relationships
between
nominals
also
called
the
configurational
model
which
was
first
proposed
by
marantz
1991
ive
argued
in
some
papers
that
the
configurational
model
is
correct
although
some
have
suggested
that
both
can
coexist
see
baker
vinokurova
2010
the
second
question
is
where
is
caseassigned
by
this
i
mean
does
case
assignment
occur
within
the
narrow
syntax
as
suggested
by
chomsky
and
argued
for
by
legate
2008
and
preminger
2011
or
does
it
occur
postsyntactically
as
suggested
by
marantz
and
later
mcfadden
2004
and
bobaljik
2008
here
too
people
have
argued
that
it
may
be
both
see
bhatt
and
walkow
to
appear
im
also
looking
at
anaphoric
binding
in
austronesian
that
sounds
interesting
have
you
noticed
any
trends
yet
what
impications
could
this
have
do
you
think
closely
relatedlanguages
in
contact
would
share
these
features
oh
cool
like
imprimir
in
spanish
which
means
print
like
a
pressing
well
most
english
speakers
cant
produce
a
decent
a
to
save
their
lives
so
why
not
i
didnt
actually
know
that
posh
has
negative
connotations
in
the
uk
i
assumed
it
might
based
on
your
class
and
social
standing
but
that
was
it
here
it
just
means
classy
perhaps
i
should
have
said
prestigious
instead
im
not
sure
if
estuary
english
should
be
called
a
prestige
accent
but
i
understand
it
is
becoming
sort
of
a
neutral
accent
if
there
is
such
a
thing
think
of
how
general
american
is
based
on
midwestern
and
great
plains
dialects
i
would
say
try
to
take
as
many
arts
courses
as
science
ones
that
would
be
a
good
mix
for
instance
you
could
do
your
major
in
philosophy
or
some
foreign
language
and
then
minor
in
computer
science
it
really
depends
on
what
you
are
planning
to
do
after
and
what
interests
you
but
i
think
this
way
you
would
get
a
really
nice
and
broad
intro
to
closely
connected
fields
and
that
will
be
useful
source
i
did
my
bsc
in
math
compsci
and
then
went
to
grad
school
in
linguistics
you
should
edit
that
book
is
kitaab
what
you
transliterated
to
sounds
more
like
writing
to
me
this
sounds
exactly
like
whats
happening
in
china
in
places
where
mandarin
isnt
the
primary
local
language
in
shanghai
a
lot
of
people
dont
bother
to
teach
their
kids
wu
shanghainese
under
the
belief
that
if
their
kids
grow
up
monolingual
in
mandarin
theyll
be
better
equipped
to
get
a
good
job
in
the
future
the
result
is
now
there
are
a
lot
of
people
under
20
who
can
understand
but
not
speak
wu
what
has
happened
historically
in
china
in
these
cases
is
that
the
local
language
be
they
sinitic
or
relatives
of
thai
hmong
or
something
else
have
left
remnants
on
the
local
sinitic
dialects
as
a
substrate
the
prestige
language
won
out
but
not
without
absorbing
elements
of
what
it
replaced
for
whats
happening
now
were
also
seeing
something
like
your
4
l
dialects
blending
together
the
dialect
of
urban
shanghai
is
already
a
blend
of
various
other
regional
wu
dialects
and
as
such
is
unique
among
wu
dialects
for
the
resulting
features
far
fewer
tones
than
other
dialects
being
the
most
notable
feature
loss
of
tone
categories
is
a
common
result
in
china
when
dialects
meet
then
that
resulting
blended
dialect
is
being
replaced
by
mandarin
let
me
know
if
you
want
more
information
on
any
of
this
it
really
sounds
identical
to
what
youre
describing
in
ireland
edit
forgot
to
mention
that
i
dont
think
it
weakens
l
by
being
a
combination
of
previous
multiple
l
dialects
i
dont
think
it
has
much
influence
on
the
loss
of
l
one
way
or
the
other
let
me
try
being
a
little
clearer
i
was
taught
that
as
in
the
examples
ive
given
the
past
perfect
should
be
used
and
that
the
conditional
only
belonged
in
the
then
clause
for
example
if
i
had
seen
it
then
i
would
have
picked
it
up
it
appears
to
be
increasingly
common
that
the
conditional
is
being
used
in
all
clauses
if
i
would
have
seen
it
then
i
would
have
picked
it
up
i
was
wondering
if
there
was
a
technical
term
for
this
particular
erroneous
use
or
if
it
just
comes
under
incorrect
or
ungrammatical
as
an
aside
my
friend
has
a
theory
that
would
have
is
felt
to
be
more
sophisticated
and
correct
than
the
simple
had
and
its
just
a
straight
substitution
much
in
the
same
way
people
mistakenly
believe
that
simplistic
is
a
more
sophisticated
way
of
saying
simple
can
you
expand
on
whats
unusual
about
prebasques
phonemic
structure
they
interviewed
nicholas
ostler
but
i
think
that
might
have
been
about
the
extent
of
it
id
like
to
see
what
john
wells
thinks
of
it
though
read
aging
with
grace
epidemiologically
speaking
snowdon
hit
the
jackpot
with
that
nunnery
he
spends
a
whole
chapter
explaining
why
it
was
indeed
a
fantastic
sample
making
blanket
statements
about
speakers
of
a
dialect
is
called
bigotry
and
in
this
particular
instance
that
bigotry
is
racism
if
youve
got
issues
with
my
moderation
youre
welcome
to
send
a
modmail
thats
a
good
question
let
me
answer
it
somewhat
indirectly
by
refining
my
original
answer
suppose
we
construct
a
list
titled
things
human
grammars
can
do
and
another
list
titled
things
macaque
grammars
can
do
are
these
lists
the
same
are
they
completely
different
do
they
have
anything
in
common
now
we
do
this
for
every
other
species
we
care
to
look
at
at
some
point
well
be
able
to
make
some
observations
or
observe
their
opposite
1
there
are
some
things
that
human
grammars
can
do
but
that
no
other
speciess
grammars
can
do
there
are
some
things
that
macaque
grammars
can
do
but
that
no
other
speciess
grammars
can
do
etc
etc
maybe
we
wont
actually
find
that
this
is
true
of
any
species
but
it
might
be
something
we
discover
2
there
are
some
things
that
no
speciess
grammars
can
do
ie
some
things
just
arent
possible
for
grammars
in
biological
systems
if
we
discover
a
case
of
1
weve
found
something
special
to
the
species
in
question
something
about
the
species
genetics
prevents
it
from
having
or
allows
or
forces
it
to
have
certain
kinds
of
grammars
but
other
species
arent
like
this
indeed
human
grammars
seem
to
be
like
this
and
probably
so
is
every
other
species
thus
theres
something
interesting
to
understand
by
studying
just
one
species
namely
what
sets
that
species
apart
linguists
study
what
sets
humans
apart
if
anything
we
call
this
universal
grammar
or
ug
for
short
because
its
the
aspect
of
grammars
which
is
universal
to
all
and
only
humans
but
we
could
really
call
it
universal
human
grammar
as
opposed
to
universal
macaque
grammar
universal
dolphin
grammar
etc
if
we
observe
2
to
be
true
then
weve
discovered
something
more
fundamental
maybe
its
simply
a
matter
of
computational
properties
these
features
are
really
hard
to
compute
so
no
species
uses
them
or
maybe
its
physical
law
these
properties
require
we
travel
back
in
time
so
no
species
uses
them
or
whatever
he
just
made
a
connection
between
socioeconomic
factors
and
intelligence
thats
pretty
widely
accepted
people
not
provided
with
a
decent
nurturing
environment
do
not
end
up
as
intelligent
as
those
with
such
advantages
blacks
are
not
the
only
speakers
of
aave
so
its
curious
that
you
jump
straight
to
accusations
of
racism
there
isnt
its
been
over
a
year
please
well
shitwhat
tense
am
i
talking
about
then
just
to
clarify
these
arent
russian
dialects
but
languages
not
closely
related
to
russian
only
two
are
even
indoeuropean
what
does
common
usage
of
unsure
phrases
mean
youll
have
to
forgive
some
of
the
failures
of
the
analysis
as
im
still
learning
this
level
of
syntax
to
answer
the
question
of
why
there
are
no
labeled
maximal
projections
its
because
im
working
with
bare
phrase
structure
the
maximal
projections
are
those
that
do
not
project
further
meaning
the
highest
branching
node
for
a
particular
label
is
the
maximal
projection
i
realize
now
that
it
doesnt
work
to
have
the
subjects
move
into
a
head
position
as
theyre
not
singular
projections
but
instead
ns
inside
of
ds
a
result
of
my
truncation
of
the
structure
requiring
movement
to
a
spec
position
as
for
zibun
i
believe
its
incorrect
for
me
to
have
labeled
it
as
a
d
to
begin
with
its
an
anaphor
so
it
should
be
able
to
move
to
a
head
position
correct
would
it
be
correct
to
say
that
zibuns
binding
domain
is
the
entire
clause
as
you
say
and
that
its
subject
oriented
im
assuming
this
allows
for
it
to
be
bound
by
both
john
and
bill
here
also
what
would
a
correct
analysis
of
japanese
structure
look
like
ive
never
worked
with
a
language
like
japanese
so
its
hard
for
me
to
come
up
with
something
from
scratch
galina
bolden
more
precisely
is
a
conversation
analyst
discourse
analysis
is
something
else

oh
the
khazars
are
so
cool
i
just
like
thinking
about
how
there
are
probably
descendants
of
khazars
jewish
and
nonjewish
scattered
across
eurasia
the
idea
that
a
few
jewish
khazars
may
have
fled
to
hungary
poland
or
elsewhere
in
eastern
europe
and
intermarried
with
jewish
populations
there
is
also
pretty
fascinating
as
for
these
guys
losing
their
accent
there
are
certain
language
acquisition
theories
that
can
somehow
describe
that
one
that
i
know
is
back
transfer
with
relation
to
language
attrition
it
could
actually
have
something
to
do
neurologically
with
our
language
processing
abilities
as
humans
as
long
as
you
are
more
exposed
and
using
a
certain
pattern
or
communicative
system
eg
spoken
second
language
more
than
the
one
that
you
used
to
mother
tongue
you
would
be
more
accustomed
to
what
youre
being
currently
and
more
frequently
oriented
with
several
linguistic
and
language
learning
studies
have
been
done
to
investigate
that
and
it
could
happen
across
different
people
who
know
different
languages
as
for
them
being
able
to
pick
up
american
english
more
than
other
immigrants
it
has
a
lot
of
factors
one
could
be
linguistic
another
could
be
psychological
motivational
for
linguistic
factors
it
does
not
mean
that
the
phonology
of
language
could
be
easily
grasped
by
a
speaker
whose
language
is
of
the
same
family
or
subfamily
we
can
instead
do
contrastive
analysis
on
phonological
systems
of
languages
involved
rather
than
try
to
box
them
based
on
the
overgeneralistic
taxonomies
you
have
to
look
at
the
segmental
wordlevel
and
prosodic
phrasesententiallevel
qualities
of
the
sound
of
both
languages
it
sounds
quite
daunting
but
you
just
have
to
have
a
keen
ear
if
you
really
want
to
understand
it
at
this
linguistic
degree
you
can
ask
questions
such
as
are
ameng
and
russian
rhotics
r
sounds
the
same
or
nearly
such
are
there
huge
vowel
similarities
these
are
the
usual
points
where
you
can
start
since
these
phonemes
are
among
the
most
prominent
ones
that
reveal
a
persons
accent
other
than
that
also
look
at
which
phonemes
are
absent
present
similar
or
different
between
two
languages
youre
comparing
take
note
that
american
english
does
not
contain
all
the
identified
sounds
of
english
and
all
other
languages
on
earth
the
same
way
other
languages
do
not
contain
all
possible
sounds
humans
can
create
agreed
in
english
the
initial
consonant
in
cat
key
queue
has
quite
a
different
place
of
articulation
than
that
in
cow
cog
cool
on
the
other
hand
palatalisation
of
other
plosives
does
not
alter
the
place
of
articulation
but
is
rather
coarticulation
with
a
palatal
yeah
i
will
but
i
dont
trust
myself
with
mistakes
so
was
waiting
for
comments
like
ureguas
i
already
have
thats
amazing
im
just
wondering
but
what
are
you
credentials
ba
ma
phd
studied
layman
and
how
many
of
you
thought
it
was
gonna
be
the
dictionary
definition
of
the
word
dictionary
though
it
would
be
cool
if
they
used
some
sort
of
microlithography
to

a
fair
point
ill
edit
it
wait
is
it
really
true
that
linguists
consider
diversity
axiomatically
desirable
there
is
a
sometimes
woolly
assumption
that
preserving
diversity
in
an
end
in
itself
but
creating
it
from
nothing
whats
the
point
having
lived
in

now

this

bogus

would
be
better
heh
well
thats
just
a
routine
instance
of
a
journalistnarrator
trying
to
create
a
story
and
make
some
compelling
or
rivetingsounding
point
for
me
the
best
type
of
news
is
source
material
and
ideally
in
video
form
i
prefer
to
watch
a
whole
speech
interview
ceremony
or
event
rather
than
reading
any
of
the
reports
about
it
because
there
is
so
much
spin
the
journalist
the
editor
and
the
publication
focusing
on
their
own
chosen
parts
of
an
occurrence
their
own
interpretation
embellishment
connections
overemphasis
of
this
underemphasis
of
that
and
all
of
the
omissions
for
the
sake
of
presenting
a
certain
agenda
or
just
for
the
sake
of
space
skim
any
list
of
headlines
of
memeorandum
and
see
agendas
in
actions
click
the
plus
sign
to
the
left
of
the
word
discussion
under
any
of
these
larger
headlines
furthermore
there
is
so
much
sarcasm
and
satirical
writing
and
blogging
that
sometimes
its
hard
to
know
what
a
journalist
or
blogger
actually
means
people
tell
me
i
have
but
i
choose
not
to
believe
them
yes
the
words
in
your
head
are
basically
in
a
big
web
with
each
word
connecting
to
others
that
sound
like
it
that
look
like
it
orthographically
and
that
have
similar
meaning
to
it
this
is
the
basis
of
the
phenomenon
of
priming
which
is
when
a
particular
word
in
the
web
is
activated
by
hearing
reading
or
otherwise
thinking
it
and
then
a
portion
of
the
web
around
that
word
activates
making
it
easier
to
recall
the
words
around
the
one
that
was
activated
that
is
right
and
a
great
point
i
gave
my
own
response
as
well
see
my
other
comment
yeah
i
guess
so
you
can
forget
about
listening
to
voseo
for
example
theres
like
this
neutral
accent
as
well
that
sounds
similar
to
mexican
spanish
perhaps
in
fact
im
so
used
to
this
dubbing
than
when
the
incredibles
was
released
in
argentina
dubbed
by
native
voice
actors
it
was
slightly
shocking
can
somebody
explain
the
difference
between
honors
degree
and
nonhonors
i
go
to
college
in
a
different
country
and
i
think
things
work
differently
here
than
in
the
states
but
you
know
id
like
to
know
for
future
reference
oh
god
grad
school
i
realized
i
was
literally
watching
a
shift
in
meaning
happen
before
my
eyes
it
was
beautiful
first
i
see
what
you
did
there
second
which
do
you
prefer
literally
as
an
intensifier
or
reduplication
of
a
syllable
from
the
word
as
an
intensifier
so
it
was
beautiful
becomes
it
was
totes
byubyu
augenblick
actually
had
a
way
bigger
impact
on
the
scandinavian
languages
that
borrowed
it
onblick
is
used
exclusively
in
swedish
for
instance
we
do
of
course
have
the
rather
strange
sl
en
sjua
literally
dialstrike
a
seven
as
a
euphemism
for
urinating
which
by
the
way
despite
being
technically
correct
sounds
like
a
euphemism
itself
just
spitballing
here
but
that
sounds
like
its
talking
about
epistemology
which
you
could
call
your
way
of
knowing
an
epistemic
stance
could
be
referring
to
somethings
intellectualphilosophical
roots
i
think
the
op
was
referring
to
successful
modification
within
a
particular
language
rather
than
successful
adoption
of
certain
languages
over
others
then
it
isnt
translated
very
well
i
speak
modern
icelandic
fluently
and
have
read
plenty
of
old
norse
literature
with
minimal
difficulty
ive
found
i
can
make
my
way
through
old
english
just
fine
after
flipping
through
a
grammar
or
two
and
having
a
dictionary
at
hand
cheap
is
always
good
i
havent
looked
into
the
other
recommendations
but
i
feared
that
it
will
take
a
huge
chunk
out
of
my
wallet
since
those
books
are
mostly
bought
by
university
students
at
least
i
think
so
thanks
a
lot
every
british
english
speaker
maybe
on
the
blink
is
british
slang
for
out
of
order
and
i
suppose
booth
would
refer
to
telephone
booth
im
not
really
sure
did
you
not
read
the
original
post
i
know
a
guy
who
was
born
in
the
us
and
speaks
fluent
bulgarian
all
of
his
family
speaks
bulgarian
but
his
friends
all
speak
either
english
only
or
english
and
spanish
in
this
case
can
you
please
please
please
tell
me
what
other
bulgarian
speakers
outside
of
his
family
have
influenced
his
acquisition
of
bulgarian
l
caught
in
a
british
accent
is
definitely
not
a
phoneme
present
in
american
english
i
have
never
in
my
life
produced
this
vowel
in
my
dialect
another
question
about
cotcaughtwhy
does
all
the
literature
contradict
what
nh
is
clearly
going
through
this
table
claims
that
i
pronounce
caught
the
way
that
distinguishers
pronounce
cot
which
simply
isnt
true
that
is
how
i
pronounce
both
of
them
this
vowel
isnt
even
in
my
dialect
nor
in
that
of
my
friends
or
family
regarding
this
has
pretty
much
every
etymology
for
important
things
in
lotr
thats
pretty
neat
thanks
for
sharing
my
french
history
is
pretty
spotty
edit
forget
it
didnt
see
it
listed
on
the
website
first
would
i
have
known
is
the
phrasing
i
would
have
used
i
feel
like
this
is
a
french
versus
german
grammar
issue
people
with
a
strong
french
background
will
be
more
annoyed
by
the
formulation
and
those
of
us
with
a
stronger
german
background
wont
even
notice
theres
something
to
talk
about
can
you
please
explain
i
didnt
even
notice
the
expressions
until
after
i
read
it
theyre
so
natural
isnt
it
kind
of
maybe
i
didnt
fully
understand

just
because

the

its

than

i
see

very
often
used

set

create
a

in

we
have
a

theres
always
been

im
not
sure
youre
really
looking
for
the
thing
that
a
lingua
franca
really
is
i
find
it
entertaining
that
youre
on
an
english
website
as
im
assuming
a
nonnative
speaker
telling
other
potentially
nonnative
speakers
that
english
isnt
is
in
english
i
think
how
its
realised
is
somewhat
dialect
dependent
as
well
as
far
as
i
know
i
would
always
pronounce
it
as
a
bilabial
approximant
or
fricative
never
as
a
stop
then
again
though
my
pronunciation
isnt
100
native
not
only
beowulf

the

georgia

i
was
surprised
georgia
the

no

insist

is
in

the

would
be
does
thank
you
the
most
obvious
one
i
can
think
of
is
to
wend
as
in
the
river
wends
its
way
southward
or
as
the
people
wend
their
way
through
the
town
the
only
context
it
is
used
for
these
days
is
when
highlighting
the
flow
of
something
but
it
is
in
fact
the
present
tense
of
went
wend
is
kept
alive
through
the
past
tense
went
which
frankly
sound
a
great
deal
nicer
than
goed
as
would
logically
be
the
past
tense
of
to
go
if
youve
got
a
problem
with
me
claiming
that
ilanguage
and
not
elanguage
is
the
object
of
study
in
theoretical
linguistics
then
why
dont
you
reply
to
that
constructively
rather
than
engaging
in
a
flame
war
because
thats
an
interesting
discussion
to
be
had
i
definitely
do
but
it
describes
the
task
not
the
person
if
i
were
a
really
bad
singer
i
might
say
singing
is
hard
but
never
im
hard
of
singing
the
online
etymology
dictionary
they
wouldnt
have
said
that
if
they
meant
the
way
the
word
is
used
colloquially
today
but
is
is
a
contraction
what
words
combine
to
make
it
to
and
fro
much
ado
derp
i
thought
you
were
just
confused
about
the
symbol
not
genuinely
intending
sorry
p
i
actually
find
the
conservative
nature
of
gaelic
spelling
to
be
helpful
here
cathair
is
recognizable
as
cognate
with
cathedra
but
its
pronounced
kah
what
about
the
great
vowel
shift
in
english
interestingly
the
singular
and
plural
are
only
implications
not
even
necessities
consider
sentences
like
if
you
have
a
childchildren
please
raise
your
hand
which
certainly
allows
you
to
raise
your
hand
if
you
have
one
or
two
or
three
kids
downward
entailing
contexts
seem
to
nullify
the
implication
of
singularity
or
plurality
for
english
grammatical
number
but
doesnt
admit
of
0
kids
oddly
interestingly
this
differs
from
language
to
language
michal
gagnon
here
at
umd
has
written
on
this
a
bit
not
too
late
at
all
us
i
think
i
seen
you
around
relevant
btw
its
somewhat
ironic
that
your
ears
seem
to
disagree
that
the
atlantic
x
is
not
the
pacific
h
tt
would
be
its
only
somewhat
standard
the
apical
vowel
is
missing
and
thats
probably
what
looks
weird
i
is
a
wu
pronunciation
of
but
i
forgot
to
type
final
so
not
standard
at
all
it
would
be
the
shanghainese
pronunciation
with
tones
presandhi
i
thought
that
was
it
but
i
was
confused
by
the
lack
of
a
nucleus
and
thought
it
was
a
typo
i
never
would
have
guessed
would
be
dz
if
youre
looking
at
dialects
of
mandarin
excluding
jin
jianghuai
and
southwest
dialects
because
those
get
mre
complex
then
yeah
tones
end
up
being
the
most
noticeable
difference
in
sichuan
the
dipping
tone
and
the
falling
tone
are
essentially
switched
tone
sandhi
in
tianjin
is
completely
different
than
what
youd
ever
expect
and
something
about
many
papers
have
been
written
sichuan
tones
are
crazy
but
i
dont
know
anything
about
tianjin
nor
jin
though
ive
heard
it
classified
as
both
a
dialect
of
mandarin
or
a
language
in
its
own
right
shanghainese
has
5
tones
and
its
debated
whether
it
and
other
wu
dialects
are
tonal
or
pitch
accent
i
go
back
and
forth
because
there
are
actually
two
different
tone
sandhi
systems
operating
in
wu
dialects
each
wordsyllablecharacterwhatever
has
an
underlying
tone
in
multisyllabic
words
there
are
a
set
number
of
contour
patterns
that
the
syllables
will
follow
this
number
is
usually
the
same
as
the
number
of
tones
the
contour
is
then
dictated
by
the
first
syllable
in
the
phrase
two
words
of
3
syllables
for
which
only
the
first
syllable
is
of
the
same
tone
will
end
up
with
identical
contours
after
sandhi
rules
are
applied
for
phrases
of
two
syllables
theres
another
sandhi
system
thats
more
similar
to
other
sinitic
languages
in
these
cases
its
the
rightmost
syllable
that
determines
the
contour
and
these
are
more
variable
in
these
cases
the
right
side
keeps
its
underlying
tone
while
the
left
side
undergoes
tonal
neutralisation
each
of
the
5
tones
in
shanghainese
also
has
a
neutral
form
which
comes
up
in
these
cases
i
can
give
examples
of
both
systems
if
you
want
but
this
has
already
gotten
long
enough
hope
it
was
clear
it
made
sense
to
me
but
it
still
sounds
like
there
are
five
phonetic
tones
and
god
knows
how
many
there
are
phonemically
the
neutral
tone
thing
sounds
very
mandarinish
to
me
and
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
it
were
due
to
language
contact
futatsu
the
question
is
about
wheres
some
pronouns
in
isolation
which
ive
personally
never
heard
or
seen
in
english
the
simple
answer
is
that
is
is
stressed
in
that
case
so
it
doesnt
get
elided
can
it
be
used
as
an
infix
damn
dude
i
cant
understand
what
youre
talking
about
i
wont
downvote
you
but
i
assure
you
it
doesnt
seem
like
you
have
enough
background
to
understand
the
topic
thats
exactly
what
some
people
did
any
way
google
wasnt
actually
objecting
to
the
word
being
used
they
just
wanted
their
company
to
be
an
intrinsic
part
of
the
the
definition
thereby
getting
their
trademark
namedropped
in
the
language
councils
word
lists
and
future
dictionaries
for
all
time
compare
to
not
be
findable
on
online
search
engines
with
to
not
be
findable
on
google
huge
difference
by
the
latter
definition
fucking
pirate
bay
is
ungoogleable
the
language
council
as
a
profitindependent
and
neutral
organisation
then
decided
to
instead
not
list
the
word
at
all
because
they
dont
want
to
favour
google
which
is
in
pr
terms
giving
the
finger
to
google
and
going
if
you
want
exclusive
use
of
the
word
then
no
one
gets
to
use
the
word
at
all
google
could
probably
push
this
issues
and
sue
the
council
to
have
their
word
added
back
the
way
they
wanted
it
to
but
that
would
be
prsuicide
of
course
anyway
i
think
the
council
has
acted
quite
right
in
this
rather
than
bow
to
corporate
pressure
they
decided
to
drop
a
seldomused
and
heard
word
from
their
list
of
new
words
that
was
the
right
reaction
i
think
well
there
are
plenty
of
latin
derivatives
in
english
so
it
might
seem
like
you
could
exchange
a
few
words
with
the
romans
guarding
hadrians
wall
honestly
though
i
dont
think
i
could
understand
spoken
latin
even
if
the
word
spoken
is
one
borrowed
directly
by
english
yes
i
wouldnt
say
can
not
is
ungrammatical
but
the
meanings
of
cannot
and
cant
are
irregular
and
they
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
as
can
not
let
me
quote
zwicky
and
pullums
1983
paper
cliticization
vs
inflection
english
nt
if
we
write
the
negation
of
p
as
notp
and
write
the
meaning
contribution
of
must
for
example
as
must
then
where
p
you
go
home
the
meaning
of
you
mustnt
go
home
is
mustnotp
not
notmustp
but
the
order
of
operators
is
reversed
when
we
consider
can
you
cant
go
home
means
notcanp
not
cannotp
it
refuses
permission
or
denies
possibility
rather
than
permitting
the
addressee
not
to
go
home
or
admitting
that
possibility
and
this
is
an
irregularity
in
the
connection
between
contracted
and
uncontracted
form
you
must
not
go
home
has
exactly
the
same
meaning
as
its
contracted
variant
but
you
can
nt
go
home
has
an
extra
meaning
that
is
lacking
in
you
cant
go
home
and
you
cnnot
go
home
any
insights
you
may
have
from
the
original

my

are

see
the
word
datv
bear
changes
case
if
the
verb
changes
tensescreeve
thats
very
unusual
i
dont
know
if
its
a
dialect
thing
but
most
of
those
words
i
only
ever
see
in
ed
form
such
as
dwelled
spelled
etc
you
use
language
to
communicate
with
others
and
in
a
dream
its
all
just
you
talking
to
yourself
but
i
speak
to
myself
in
specific
languages
do
you
speak
to
yourself
in
your
head
in
no
particular
language
my
first
exposure
to
bp
was
carioca
rio
dialect
so
when
i
heard
a
paolista
in
some
listening
exercise
i
was
like
wow
this
american
speaks
well
but
she
needs
to
work
on
her
rs
ive
found
strength
of
publication
record
to
be
the
most
consistent
one
which
is
one
reason
postdocs
are
becoming
more
common
that
extra
1
or
2
years
typically
gives
the
applicant
who
did
a
postdoc
an
edge
on
publications
its
possible
to
have
a
strong
publication
record
even
just
finishing
a
phd
but
with
an
extra
year
or
two
you
can
often
turn
thesis
chapters
into
journal
articles
plus
maybe
get
your
name
on
a
few
papers
from
whichever
lab
hires
you
as
postdoc
dying
words
is
pop
linguistics
its
published
by
wileyblackwell
and
has
a
poopton
of
citations
im
just
curious
if
this
doesnt
look
like
an
academic
book
what
does
yup
here
you
go
ah
good
to
know
i
was
just
writing
something
quickly
arra
could
you
give
that
in
kana
rr
is
not
possible
in
japanese
right
so
then
we
cant
claim
that
the
temporal
priority
of
meaning
formulation
when
producing
sentences
is
a
good
reason
to
have
grammatical
rules
make
reference
to
semantics
because
rules
being
a
form
of
knowledge
could
in
principle
be
quite
distinct
from
how
we
use
those
rules
in
production
or
processing
i
can
sympathize
with
the
idea
that
actively
teaching
something
as
wrong
is
a
terrible
thing
to
do
i
was
raised
in
west
virginia
and
were
all
taught
about
how
the
dialect
is
categorically
ungrammatical
and
wrong
i
dont
have
an
accent
now
im
guessing
because
i
consciously
resisted
it
when
i
was
a
kid
my
parents
have
virginian
accents
and
my
sister
has
a
wv
accent
i
dont
think
i
would
have
done
that
if
i
had
thought
of
it
as
a
neutral
or
a
good
accent
interestingly
when
trying
to
sound
businesslike
and
corporate
theres
a
tendency
toward
the
opposite
lots
of
germanic
words
and
phrasal
verbs
this
is
only
a
single
example
but
gontzal
aldai
has
numerous
publications
on
basque
some
with
bernard
comrie
they
wont
help
you
to
learn
basque
of
course
but
they
might
be
helpful
with
more
advanced
issues
down
the
road
theyre
derived
from
that
but
theyre
a
single
morpheme
now
yes
but
are
they
part
of
phrasal
verbs
in
latin
then
you
dont
understand
tomasello
sorry
this
might
not
be
exactly
what
youre
after
but
after
all
gender
is
arguably
just
a
specific
instantiation
of
noun
class
in
kinyarwanda
may
be
true
of
other
bantu
languages
something
to
look
into
the
noun
which
means
god
belongs
to
the
noun
class
which
otherwise
contains
manmade
things
thank
you
very
much
that
gives
me
a
bit
of
a
mood
lift
im
glad
my
post
was
received
as
intended
by
at
least
a
few
people
one
of
whom
is
even
an
expert
to
boot
they
both
have
retroflex
consonants
we
actually
had
a
thread
a
long
while
back
as
in
over
a
year
ago
where
rlinguistics
people
read
that
passage
out
i
dont
know
if
i
can
find
it
again
but
heres
my
rendition
at
least
for
op
i
believe
my
accent
has
changed
a
little
since
then
though
edit
found
the
post
it
was
an
attempt
at
a
joke
as
in
the
professor
is
unavailable
for
2
weeks
because
hell
be
exclusively
thinking
about
ops
question
nevermind
ipa
can
handle
stressing
its
pretty
much
only
good
for
the
english
language
though
as
english
has
about
50
phonemes
that
it
uses
other
languages
may
have
more
or
less
and
so
ipa
wont
correctly
transcribe
them
is
it
pictographic
as
long
as
you
can
demonstrate
speaking
and
teaching
proficiency
in
the
languages
that
your
job
is
expecting
you
to
use
when
teaching
you
should
be
fine
perhaps
this
wont
be
a
surprising
comment
given
my
flair
but
phonetics
is
also
about
acoustics
and
perception
not
just
production
and
i
second
the
suggestion
to
peruse
previous
discussions
about
the
bad
job
market
get
into
bible
translation
plenty
of
jobs
there
plenty
of
languages
that
either
dont
have
a
written
alphabet
or
just
dont
have
a
translation
in
their
vernacular
i
know
a
guy
whos
going
to
live
with
a
group
of
people
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
in
siberia
in
order
to
get
them
a
bible
in
their
native
language
they
speak
russian
but
theres
no
existing
translation
for
the
language
they
speak
in
their
homes
doesnt
really
pay
much
and
im
sure
its
difficult
but
i
think
itd
be
pretty
rewarding
even
if
youre
not
religious
getting
to
work
with
a
piece
of
literature
that
important
seems
like
a
neat
job
dont
know
the
numbers
but
comparative
literature
is
a
reletively
minor
field
of
study
its
not
the
people
majoring
in
english
or
even
a
specific
literature
which
get
degrees
in
the
language
they
study
of
course
linguistics
relatively
speaking
is
a
small
field
too
im
going
to
go
with
elision
verb
form
to
elide
i
see
it
used
in
other
languages
as
well
pax
is
used
wordwide
it
seems
in
hotel
tourism
aviation
etc
in
italian
wed
use
dx
destra
right
and
sx
sinistra
left
it
is
different
than
the
x
used
in
other
contexts
xmas
because
of
the
greek
letter
chi
again
in
italy
ive
seen
xsachiesa
i
think
the
x
in
xfertransfer
again
is
different
in
that
xtrans
or
even
cross
ie
xcultural
for
iconic
reasons
i
agree
i
had
to
do
a
very
similar
survey
for
my
sociolinguistics
class
last
spring
i
posted
the
link
to
rsamplesize
and
got
close
to
a
hundred
responses
and
some
interesting
results
for
comparison
ive
marked
the
differences
in
ukrainian
from
the
russian
russian
ukrainian
funny
ive
never
thought
of
lambda
calculus
as
a
substructural
logic
probably
because
i
think
of
substructural
logics
in
terms
of
sequent
calculi
and
ive
never
seen
a
sequent
presentation
of
untyped
lambda
calculus
do
you
consider
it
the
most
general
since
adding
different
typing
rules
gives
so
many
different
logics
or
is
it
for
some
other
reason
i
dont
see
how
the
phrases
are
related
in
meaning
they
dont
share
any
common
forms
and
i
dont
know
where
im
supposed
to
get
the
information
theyre
asking
for
from
sorry
i
meant
english
shows
a
lot
of
the
loss
of
more
complicated
systems
lots
of
analogy
and
levelling
and
lots
of
outside
influence
from
the
first
comment
rather
than
the
dying
out
part
and
being
replaced
part
did
english
use
accents
like
or
are
those
just
pronunciation
helpers
in
old
english
literature
that
werent
actually
used
today
i
think
italian
uses
those
as
well
so
why
are
they
gone
if
they
were
importing
printing
presses
from
italy
they
should
have
been
available
as
well
shouldnt
they
so
confusing
same
thing
goes
for
frisian
if
you
ask
a
frisian
or
someone
who
knows
anything
about
languages
theyll
tell
you
its
a
language
a
dutch
person
will
tell
you
its
just
a
stupid
dialect
i
once
tried
to
explain
to
someone
how
frisian
is
older
than
dutch
so
there
was
no
way
the
first
could
be
a
dialect
of
the
latter
she
concluded
with
well
i
just
think
its
a
dialect
hmm
sounds
like
its
probably
not
a
fullblown
so
to
speak
implosive
i
think
real
implosives
would
be
fairly
obvious
inwardpressurewise
i
dont
know
enough
about
australian
dialects
to
know
how
eg
stop
consonant
articulation
varies
among
them
or
between
them
and
other
english
dialects
pomme
orange
orangecolored
apple
i
find
it
interesting
that
russian
has
for
oranges
presumably
from
chinese
apple
as
indicated
above
but
the
word
for
apple
is
and
not
say
something
like
anyone
know
why
this
might
be
danish
uses
orange
for
the
color
and
appelsin
for
the
fruit
today
in
bengali
theyre
both
komla
i
dont
know
much
about
the
etymology
but
its
not
related
to
the
word
found
in
other
north
indian
languages
come
on
im
naranja
roll
here
ill
be
going
now
this
confuses
me
to
hell
im
no
native
english
speaker
but
i
am
very
sure
you
pronounce
it
like
that
in
spoken
language
ie
the
other
vs
the
next
check
out
rmapporn
is
it
really
so
foreign
an
idea
that
they
might
not
look
at
scans
but
at
versions
with
updated
orthography
thats
the
reverse
of
what
op
is
asking
japanese
originally
was
written
entirely
in
chinese
characters
and
then
they
switched
over
to
a
partial
syllabary
system
op
is
asking
if
theres
any
language
that
was
originally
written
in
an
alphabet
or
a
syllabary
and
then
switched
over
to
logograms
on
a
related
note
one
thing
ive
noticed
is
the
sentencefinal
tag
innit
presumably
from
isnt
it
being
a
common
feature
of
english
spoken
by
many
native
americans
even
those
whose
languages
are
not
at
all
related
does
anyone
know
how
this
originated
i
have
an
electronic
version
of
the
book
do
you
remember
any
key
words
i
could
search
for
conference
did
not
find
anything
like
this
i
totally
notice
this
i
come
from
an
array
of
places
in
the
south
but
mostly
texas
my
accent
is
very
very
centralnorthish
texan
and
i
absolutely
love
it
morphophonology
is
usually
more
interesting
to
me
than
anything
else
which
is
why
i
had
originally
selected
polish
and
the
ghost
segments
seem
pretty
interesting
the
main
problem
im
facing
is
a
lack
of
sources
i
need
enough
material
to
work
with
to
get
at
least
12
pages
out
of
but
90
of
polish
linguistic
work
i
find
is
written
in
polish
which
i
dont
actually
speak
more
than
anything
i
need
a
topic
that
is
covered
well
enough
so
that
i
can
find
more
than
one
article
context
matters
although
id
never
say
data
are
i
would
write
it

edit
why
the
downvote
did
you
mean
quality
the
second
time
too
instead
of
quantity
uminotaurusrex
err
no
theres
a
notion
of
standard
in
english
in
the
same
way
as
theres
a
notion
of
standard
in
any
language
usage
if
a
small
minority
of
people
use
a
particular
form
its
nonstandard
i
think
your
perception
of
singular
they
as
already
being
widespread
and
accepted
might
be
skewed
as
for
the
question
of
why
if
the
monkeys
were
owned
by
the
children
you
may
want
to
use
a
possessive
pronoun
wed
probably
use
their
ohh
yes
that
makes
significantly
more
sense
while
i
know
this
is
all
super
intro
semantics
im
not
great
at
the
formalisms
the
entitiestruthvalue
stuff
is
the
hardest
for
me
to
grasp
and
seems
to
be
the
most
fundamental
part
of
understanding
how
semantics
works
generally
my
prof
doesnt
do
well
with
explaining
to
those
who
arent
familiar
with
logic
but
i
appreciate
that
explanation
thank
you
this
is
common
in
germanic
languages
but
protogermanic
was
the
same
as
all
european
languages
in
this
respect
in
dutch
i
cant
think
of
any
pairs
of
words
where
the
two
words
have
the
same
root
but
there
are
some
pairs
of
words
where
the
stress
changes
the
meaning
for
example
verspringen
long
jump
verspringen
jump
to
a
different
position
eg
for
hand
of
a
clock
voorkomen
show
up
in
front
of
a
judge
voorkomen
prevent
no
kidding
til
thanks
amelioration
maybe
nevermind
youre
looking
for
a
word
for
the
word
not
the
process
it
seems
that
way
my
friend
interesting
its
the
same
in
chabacano
no
doubt
because
of
the
influence
of
tagalog
so
correr
becomes
kohri
etc
can
i
help
you
puedo
ayudarte
there
are
lots
of
other
examples
where
infinitive
doesnt
contain
to
often
with
auxiliary
verbs
but
it
remains
an
infinitive
ok
i
see
your
position
but
still
my
problem
is
not
with
the
definition
of
the
equivalence
relation
or
with
the
distinction
between
necessary
and
sufficient
causes
i
still
dont
see
how
having
a
feminine
equivalent
is
an
interesting
property
heres
an
analogy
if
i
said
it
seems
that
all
murderers
have
eyes
so
i
suppose
that
having
eyes
may
cause
being
murderous
well
of
course
murderers
tend
to
have
eyes
everyone
murderer
or
not
tends
to
have
eyes
there
isnt
even
a
correlation
there
thats
how
i
see
the
feminine
equivalent
claim
of
course
all
feminine
borrowings
have
a
feminine
equivalent
all
words
feminine
or
not
tend
to
have
a
feminine
equivalent
now
if
you
wanted
you
may
want
to
say
that
having
eyes
is
technically
a
necessary
condition
to
being
a
criminal
but
youll
agree
that
this
wouldnt
be
enlightening
at
all
as
far
as
figuring
out
the
causes
of
murder
go
i
didnt
know
there
is
a
name
for
that
phenomenon
portuguese
expats
living
in
spain
do
that
a
lot
and
say
stuff
like
yo
pieno
pienso
que
when
two
languages
are
relatively
similar
i
guess
learners
build
these
mental
shortcuts
to
translate
words
which
miay
be
useful
when
you
need
to
pick
up
the
language
fast
but
its
also
prone
to
all
kind
of
funny
mispronunciations
im
sure
there
has
to
be
research
on
the
topic
out
there
edit
grammar
yeah
i
tried
google
translating
knight
into
german
but
what
i
got
was
ritter
which
i
guessed
about
the
rider
link
i
graduated
from
ucsd
in
1985
i
also
chaired
the
marshall
college
student
council
ucsd
is
a
fantastic
university
that
said
you
better
be
ready
san
diego
offers
a
massive
distraction
additionally
the
uc
system
uses
a
quarter
system
rather
then
a
semester
system
the
quarters
run
about
10
weeks
you
will
be
having
mid
term
examinations
the
3rd
week
of
the
quarter
it
is
really
fast
youre
absolutely
right
and
to
be
honest
we
often
learn
more
from
the
pioneers
mistakes
than
from
their
successes
i
do
want
to
learn
what
generativism
has
to
offer
without
necessarily
enlisting
to
defend
it
you
realize
every
word
in
there
except
horrible
and
germanic
is
a
germanic
word
right
its
quite
common
for
the
same
word
to
diverge
in
meaning
in
different
languages
i
can
think
of
another
example
where
a
language
borrowed
a
word
it
already
had
but
with
a
change
in
meaning
the
protogermanic
word
skurto
became
english
shirt
and
norse
skyrta
both
meaning
shirt
however
when
the
vikings
invaded
britain
english
borrowed
skyrta
from
norse
changing
its
meaning
to
skirt
thus
english
has
two
words
referring
to
two
separate
items
of
clothing
both
of
which
came
from
exactly
the
same
root
word
the
same
root
word
also
became
german
schrze
which
means
apron
okay

the
most
relevant
dimension
of
cognitive
style
for
our
purposes
has
to
do
with
the
extent
to
which
people
use
their
vision
systems
to
perform
tasks
other
than
vision
although
weve
sort
of
been
taking
it
for
granted
so
far
that
everyone
performs
visual
simulation
theres
actually
quite
a
lot
of
variability
across
individuals
in
the
extent
to
which
people
do
so
at
the
most
extreme
end
about
3
percent
of
people
report
never
having
visual
imagery
at
all
and
this
is
among
people
with
normal
visiion
whether
or
not
their
intuition
about
their
conscious
experience
of
imagery
is
also
indicative
of
how
they
unconsciously
use
embodied
simulation
theres
lots
of
clear
evidence
that
there
are
people
who
tend
to
perform
cognitive
tasks
through
language
rather
than
through
simulated
vision
these
people
are
often
called
verbalizers
contrasted
with
visualizers
okay
so
then
he
talks
about
what
the
differences
are
between
these
cognitive
styles
for
a
few
pages
on
page
169
he
talks
a
little
more
explicitly
on
what
this
means
for
language
processing
in
principle
it
could
be
that
people
with
different
cognitive
styles
not
only
harbor
different
preferences
for
vivid
visual
description
versus
witty
banter
but
that
when
forced
to
read
a
given
text
they
also
display
different
capacities
for
encoding
and
recalling
its
content
depending
on
what
its
about
one
recent
study
stands
out
in
that
it
relates
properties
of
peoples
embodied
simulations
during
intentional
imagery
and
during
language
comprehension
theres
an
interesting
visual
illusion
called
the
motion
aftereffect
you
might
have
experienced
it
before
it
happens
to
me
when
im
hiking
in
the
woods
for
a
while
when
i
come
to
stop
the
trees
look
for
a
brief
instant
like
theyre
moving
forward
away
from
me
people
also
report
that
they
have
the
effect
when
staring
at
a
waterfall
for
a
while
when
they
then
turn
to
look
at
something
stationary
say
the
mossy
wall
next
to
the
waterfall
it
appears
to
be
moving
upward
argh
this
is
taking
a
long
time
for
me
to
type
out
so
ill
summarize
from
here
there
was
a
study
at
stanford
that
looked
at
this
motion
aftereffect
when
people
read
a
passage
people
would
read
a
passage
describing
motion
upwards
or
downwards
and
then
say
which
direction
dots
on
a
new
screen
were
moving
presumably
if
you
embody
the
motion
from
the
passage
then
you
will
also
see
the
dots
moving
that
same
direction
consistent
with
the
embodied
thought
they
found
that
people
who
have
a
stronger
motion
aftereffect
with
imagery
also
have
a
stronger
motion
aftereffect
during
language
comprehension
p
172
this
suggests
that
visualizers
have
more
vivid
or
longerlasting
embodied
simulations
of
motion
when
theyre
reading
language
about
things
moving
than
people
with
other
cognitive
styles
p
172
im
not
saying
i
personally
agree
with
this
in
fact
the
fact
that
people
have
different
cognitive
styles
seems
to
me
a
pretty
big
problem
for
the
theory
of
embodied
cognition

i
like
this
line
theres
some
slight
possibly
coincidental
correspondence
between
the
meanings
of
the
semitic
names
of
adjacent
letters
for
example
the
yodkaphlamed
sequence
meaning
hand
palm
cattle
prod
it
makes
me
think
that
it
was
a
hand
clapping
game
patacake
patacake
bakers
man
thats
very
stilted
and
broken
in
your
opinion
just
wow
im
not
protesting
at
people
saying
that
nikolaj
costerwaldau
has
an
accent
i
dont
even
have
a
problem
with
people
saying
that
he
has
a
foreign
accent
as
ive
said
elsewhere
he
certainly
has
a
danish
accent
that
is
noticeable
enough
to
place
him
geographically
if
i
didnt
know
that
he
was
danish
i
would
have
placed
him
either
in
denmark
or
in
netherlands
its
the
choice
of
calling
that
stilted
and
broken
that
i
take
issue
with
there
is
a
massive
difference
between
saying
that
someone
has
an
accent
and
calling
their
speech
stilted
and
broken
historically
many
native
lowprestige
accents
have
also
been
called
that
and
today
people
rightly
take
exception
to
that
why
people
think
that
its
fine
to
call
a
foreign
accent
when
attributed
to
a
person
who
is
clearly
fluent
save
that
nonnative
tone
in
their
speech
that
i
do
not
know
no
it
doesnt
change
tone
instead
of
conjugation
and
lexical
tone
is
not
prosody
like
i
said
its
not
really
difficult
its
just
a
new
way
of
thinking
we
could
do
it
in
english
its
just
that
we
choose
not
to
its
not
just
the
verbs
of
motion
no
the
prefixes
can
be
added
to
other
verbs
too
though
they
tend
to
change
the
meaning
a
lot
more
for
those
verbs
the
new
meaning
isnt
always
obvious
based
on
the
root
and
the
prefix
so
it
does
take
a
bit
more
work
than
native
speakers
may
think
you
are
quite
correct
finnish
and
hungarian
are
indeed
related
they
both
belong
to
the
uralic
family
of
languages
another
european
relative
is
estonian
otherwise
its
pretty
much
some
small
minority
languages
many
of
which
teeter
on
the
brink
of
extinction
so
not
totally
unique
but
a
member
of
a
rather
obscure
family
its
pretty
different
from
the
indoeuropean
languages
so
i
doubt
youd
be
able
to
understand
much
in
addition
to
all
the
old
vocabulary
that
has
either
been
borrowed
ages
ago
or
is
of
uralic
origin
finnish
and
the
common
indoeuropean
donor
languages
such
as
english
have
such
radically
different
grammar
phonology
and
phonotactics
that
direct
borrowing
is
rather
unlikely
even
though
there
are
plenty
of
loan
words
of
indoeuropean
among
others
origin
they
have
mostly
been
assimilated
through
a
variety
of
means
for
instance
as
calques
or
neologisms
a
good
recent
example
is
the
word
for
hard
disk
which
is
literally
translated
as
kovalevy
a
computer
is
tietokone
literally
knowledge
machine
in
many
other
languages
a
word
such
as
computer
would
retain
much
of
its
original
form
but
that
is
usually
not
the
case
in
finnish
in
addition
to
that
finnish
is
a
highly
agglutinative
language
which
means
that
where
eg
english
uses
adpositions
we
stack
a
whole
number
of
mostly
suffixes
to
any
given
word
suffice
to
say
that
does
tend
to
present
some
challenges
to
foreigners
trying
to
gain
even
a
modicum
of
understanding
it
is
fascinating
though
how
much
one
can
pick
up
of
one
language
of
a
family
from
knowing
another
especially
if
a
language
doesnt
feel
the
need
to
translate
its
loanwords
edit
also
bratislava
is
a
cool
place
to
visit
but
damn
did
it
have
some
creepy
statues
in
the
old
town
nearly
gave
me
a
heart
attack
the
mansized
one
emerging
from
the
sewers
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
tones
are
not
that
difficult
i
wouldnt
even
say
theyre
necessarily
the
most
difficult
part
of
chinese
pronunciation
of
course
it
uses
idioms
every
language
uses
idioms
english
uses
idioms
as
well
and
most
czech
idioms
dont
work
in
english
either
and
if
you
mean
those
four
character
idioms
you
need
to
know
only
a
few
most
common
ones
most
of
them
are
almost
never
used
yes
the
writing
system
is
hard
but
you
need
only
a
passive
knowledge
of
most
characters
which
is
much
easier
than
learning
to
write
them
so
far
as
i
know
theres
only
one
algorithm
out
there
thats
even
capable
of
reconstructing
protoforms
can
you
please
guide
me
to
the
relevant
paper
i
would
be
very
much
interested
in
this
algorithm
thanks
whoops
yeah
sorry
both
are
acceptable
translations
and
i
meant
to
use
the
one
with
a
copula
well
as
i
said
this
is
a
mistake
that
a
native
speaker
would
have
been
very
unlikely
to
make
i
didnt
say
that
it
was
or
should
be
impossible
so
i
dont
quite
understand
why
you
appear
to
be
attempting
to
prove
wrong
my
general
point
by
only
stating
that
my
anecdote
does
not
apply
to
you
ill
explain
anyway
in
case
you
honestly
do
not
understand
of
course
there
are
several
factors
that
play
a
role
in
whether
or
not
a
native
speaker
knows
certain
phenomena
from
his
or
her
culture
age
is
an
important
one
as
is
level
of
education
subcultural
involvement
etc
now
i
dont
know
your
age
but
the
affair
between
clinton
and
lewinsky
took
place
between
1995
and
1996
about
seventeen
years
ago
when
clinton
was
50
it
is
likely
that
certain
things
that
were
widely
known
to
clinton
and
the
subtitler
who
may
be
closer
in
age
to
clinton
than
to
you
that
are
no
longer
as
familiar
to
younger
people
perhaps
the
english
literature
reading
curricula
no
longer
recommend
the
book
or
perhaps
it
has
fallen
from
grace
with
teachers
perhaps
school
boards
have
banned
it
for
its
sensual
naturethere
are
other
possible
reasons
too
for
why
you
may
not
know
the
book
perhaps
youre
a
native
speaker
who
does
not
like
to
read
maybe
you
studied
russian
literature
extensively
but
know
nothing
of
american
poetry
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
short
no
not
knowing
one
book
title
does
not
make
you
not
a
native
speaker
but
being
a
native
speaker
does
make
you
more
likely
to
know
a
title
or
a
reference
you
would
likely
snigger
at
a
diner
called
green
eggs
and
burgers
and
have
an
inkling
of
what
is
referred
to
when
someone
says
do
not
talk
about
fight
club
as
to
your
other
question
does
one
need
to
be
familiar
with
every
book
ever
published
in
the
us
to
be
an
interpreter
id
like
to
think
one
does
not
frankly
i
think
it
would
be
an
impossibility
because
of
the
sheer
volume
of
books
published
annually
however
in
order
to
translate
or
interpret
you
need
to
have
an
above
average
understanding
of
the
canon
of
general
knowledge
that
the
source
audience
and
the
target
audience
has
you
may
also
need
additional
expertise
if
youre
translating
for
a
specific
subject
you
also
need
to
have
a
gut
feeling
for
when
a
cultural
reference
comes
up
even
if
you
dont
know
what
it
specifically
refers
to
a
good
translator
interpreter
even
if
they
did
not
recognize
the
title
of
the
book
would
have
realized
that
something
was
fishy
about
ms
lewiskys
statement
because
the
president
of
the
us
would
likely
not
present
an
illicit
lover
with
actual
grass
at
that
point
the
translator
would
have
had
several
choices
in
a
scenario
where
they
have
only
30
seconds
to
output
a
subtitle
otherwise
a
translator
should
just
do
the
research
leave
the
item
out
of
the
translation
entirely
or
translate
with
a
very
generic
statement
such
as
and
something
else
present
the
target
audience
with
the
english
phrase
while
indicating
that
it
remains
untranslated
translate
literally
and
hope
for
the
best
guess
wildly
personally
id
choose
option
two
because
it
gives
the
target
audience
the
tools
to
supply
themselves
with
the
knowledge
that
i
cant
give
them
at
that
point
however
live
subtitling
and
its
oral
sibling
interpreting
is
extremely
strenuous
work
it
is
very
understandable
that
someone
would
not
have
flawless
performance
throughout
an
entire
interview
even
if
they
were
working
in
teams
in
case
i
wasnt
clear
enough
just
being
a
native
speaker
or
just
being
good
at
a
language
does
not
automatically
make
you
a
suitable
translator
or
interpreter
and
someone
who
is
not
a
native
speaker
can
sometimes
adequately
compensate
as
a
translator
by
being
welltrained
and
aware
of
pitfalls
i
wonder
since
they
are
adding
these
if
theyre
going
to
add
translators
for
swiss
german
and
austrian
german
i
can
see
how
they
make
sense
a
chair
is
for
one
person
who
fully
occupies
it
that
is
who
is
in
it
a
couch
has
room
for
more
stuff
the
person
is
just
a
part
of
it
chairs
are
in
the
movies
but
couches
are
on
television
thank
you
maybe
20
different
people
showed
me
that
ultraconserved
words
article
and
explaining
why
it
was
bullshit
to
each
of
them
was
so
time
consuming
itll
be
much
more
efficient
to
send
them
this
link
wtf
are
you
talking
about
im
more
inclined
to
agree
with
you
he
is
much
more
articulate
than
everyone
else
in
the
story
so
its
more
likely
that
hes
of
a
higher
social
class
than
the
rest
of
the
sailors
just
because
of
his
education
the
next
question
is
how
much
has
the
dialect
either
ishmaels
new
york
dialect
or
the
whalers
dialects
changed
since
then
do
we
have
any
record
of
specific
sound
changes
between
then
and
now
thats
a
common
dialectal
variation
in
the
uk
too
your
answer
is
quite
politic
what
a
damn
shame
considering
how
monumental
early
indian
work
was
to
our
field
well
its
clear
that
some
modification
invention
went
on
in
borrowing
the
alphabet
from
phoenician
to
greek
we
know
this
was
the
case
for
vowels
which
were
developed
by
extending
the
usage
of
phoenician
semivowels
as
well
as
the
pharyngeals
which
the
greeks
surely
wouldve
been
unfamiliar
with
the
letter
omega
for
example
was
originally
just
a
letter
o
with
a
line
underneath
to
show
that
it
was
mega
instead
of
micron
this
was
a
greek
modification
for
something
that
they
felt
was
a
necessary
distinction
as
for
the
diplas
i
pointed
out
in
another
comment
here
that
stopsibilant
clusters
are
the
only
kind
of
consonant
clusters
that
can
appear
in
any
part
of
a
word
in
ancient
greek
initial
medial
or
final
so
maybe
for
that
reason
they
perceived
these
sequences
as
individual
phonemes
and
thus
felt
they
should
get
their
own
letters
because
the
symbol
looks
like
hashmarksand
it
is
used
now
to
tag
topics
how
is
this
even
a
linguistics
question
its
not
about
grammar
its
about
language
in
general
so
apparently
people
have
been
making
this
mistake
for
a
while
did
not
know
that
how
has
using
google
docs
forms
for
your
survey
worked
out
im
interested
in
the
pros
and
cons
because
im
thinking
of
doing
a
similar
project
myself
its
an
auxdrop
question
see
fitzpatrick
2006
for
an
analysis
and
some
more
facts
theres
no
account
in
the
paper
for
the
prosodification
of
these
questions
but
they
seem
to
share
the
same
prosody
as
yesno
questions
does
anyone
like
coffee
these
also
license
npis
which
is
common
to
questions
this
is
the
one
that
came
to
mind
for
me
we
show
it
to
all
our
lin
undergrads
at
the
beginning
of
introduction
linguistics
is
not
language
or
literature
you
can
certainly
discuss
language
and
literature
in
linguistic
terms
but
this
video
is
offtopic
selfpromotion
i
would
like
a
translation
but
im
too
lazy
to
use
google
lets
be
honest
this
post
was
a
request
for
a
circlejerk
about
the
superpowers
one
can
attain
by
studying
linguistics
right
the
op
was
asking
whether
linguists
feel
that
their
studies
have
conferred
an
advantage
in
learning
languages
and
the
responses
are
providing
this
information
the
word
circlejerk
is
hardly
applicable
im
finnish
though
my
countrymen
try
to
use
tourists
to
improve
their
english
all
the
time
hard
for
foreigners
to
learn
finnish
wals
is
the
best
for
all
things
typological
does
it
ever
get
to
a
point
where
the
family
just
gets
to
make
up
how
its
pronounced
er
yes
are
you
really
going
around
telling
people
how
to
pronounce
their
own
names
i
think
its
unreasonable
to
expect
an
english
speaker
from
a
different
region
to
imitate
your
vowel
sounds
exactly
theres
always
going
to
be
some
uh
what
would
you
call
it
vowel
translation
for
example
i
know
that
youre
not
supposed
to
say
gahn
or
gone
different
in
my
accent
at
the
end
of
oregon
its
supposed
be
an
unstressed
or
schwa
vowel
but
for
the
first
syllable
its
going
to
be
close
to
how
i
pronounce
origami
or
orange
in
my
own
accent
i
shouldnt
have
to
do
a
bad
impression
of
someones
accent
when
i
say
the
name
of
their
city
i
dont
pronounce
chicago
with
a
flat
a
or
new
orleans
with
a
drawl
though
i
am
more
likely
now
to
elide
the
new
into
the
orleans
it
gets
particularly
weird
when
youre
in
england
and
you
talk
about
bath
it
sounds
ridiculous
when
an
american
says
bahth
they
wouldnt
expect
a
liverpudlian
to
say
it
the
same
way
a
londoner
would
similarly
how
is
an
american
supposed
to
say
cairns
in
australia
its
sounds
wrong
no
matter
how
you
say
it
do
you
have
an
evidencebased
source
that
states
children
are
delayed
until
the
age
of
six
i
am
curious
because
ive
never
seen
anything
to
that
effect
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
claim
do
other
people
in
the
uk
not
like
constructions
like
ive
two
cars
because
im
from
the
us
and
my
brain
makes
such
a
sentence
acceptable
by
putting
it
in
a
british
accent
you
would
never
hear
someone
in
the
us
say
it
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
in
our
dialect
have
as
an
auxiliary
verb
can
be
contracted
while
have
as
a
main
verb
cannot
in
your
dialect
that
rule
doesnt
exist
so
its
kind
of
both
a
dialectspecific
rule
ive
two
cars
as
well
as
theyve

sounds
correct
to
me
but
theyve
your
car
does
not
strangely
ive
your
car
sounds
correct
the
pdf
would
be
fantastic
thanks
i
grew
up
not
knowing
there
was
such
a
thing
as
linguistics
but
being
utterly
fascinated
by
languages
accents
figures
of
speech
the
histories
of
words
etc
when
i
found
out
theres
a
science
called
linguistics
i
dropped
everything
and
went
to
school
for
it
im
majoring
in
linguistics
now
and
after
taking
my
first
class
in
it
freshman
year
i
pretty
much
died
of
happiness
next
semester
im
taking
a
lin
class
about
phonetics
and
an
anthropologylinguistics
crosscourse
about
symbols
and
cultures
and
im
going
to
cream
my
god
damn
jeans
its
nice
to
see
another
linguist
being
created
i
love
knowing
that
other
people
have
a
passion
for
linguistics
too
on
a
sidenote
this
makes
puns
in
chinese
and
japanese
pretty
amusing
yeah
my
daughter
is
two
and
when
i
ask
can
you
do
it
or
do
you
want
me
to
help
you
she
replies
help
you
i
think
its
what
youre
describing
same
reason
as
why
spoken
languages
arent
universal
dialects
exist
because
there
isnt
standardised
system
for
bsl
youre
welcome
there
is
no
gender
based
pronoun
however
you
can
specify
gender
by
adding
gender
to
pronoun
in
formal
setting
and
when
translating
interpreter
sometimes
ask
you
which
gender
is
it
and
most
just
say
that
person
20000
is
sometimes
given
as
a
maximum
vocabulary
size
the
oed
has
about
600000
definitions
but
deciding
what
is
and
is
not
actually
a
word
is
a
bit
difficult
haha
i
still
think
two
handed
fingerspelling
is
better
even
after
years
of
signing
one
handed
fingerspelling
in
my
first
sl
no
is
this
this
hammer
this
sickle
this
our
soviet
coat
of
arms
you
want
reap
and
you
want
forge
anyway
youll
get
honeycake
this
is
a
hammer
this
is
a
sickle
this
is
our
soviet
coat
of
arms
you
can
reap
or
you
can
forge
anyway
youll
get
the
obvious
rhyme
is
cock
a
honeycake
interesting
so
it
does
sound
similar
to
over
here
here
there
is
see
which
means
signed
exact
english
and
is
mostly
used
by
oralists
pse
pidgin
sign
english
which
mixes
asl
elements
with
lots
of
english
and
of
course
asl
from
what
youve
seen
of
asl
or
lsf
or
any
from
that
family
what
differences
have
you
noticed
besides
vocabulary
which
will
obviously
be
very
different
i
realize
you
may
have
limited
knowledge
of
these
other
sign
languages

german
dear

this
game
is
hard
so
a
dentist
chair
is
not
a
typical
chair
and
while
a
chair
is
a
typical
piece
of
furniture
the
untypicalness
of
the
dentist
chair
in
the
lower
category
makes
it
more
untypical
for
the
higher
category
i
think
the
prototype
theory
is
not
about
includingexluding
its
about
the
prototypicalness
of
objects
in
their
categorys
a
typical
mistake
by
native
german
speakers
learning
the
standard
orthography
is
the
confusion
of
the
the
homophones
rad
and
rat
and
other
similar
examples
of
ablaut
other
features
such
as
the
realisation
of
ig
and
the
lack
of
representation
of
the
initial
glottal
stops
before
vowels
would
be
some
of
the
factors
that
make
german
orthography
a
poor
example
of
a
phonetic
script
it
is
quite
regular
though
to
its
credit
ive
seen
this
problem
many
times
and
with
many
languages
the
two
words
that
ive
seen
mixed
the
most
are
right
and
left
we
all
probably
learned
those
two
words
the
same
day
or
on
the
same
page
of
our
language
book
my
french
teacher
for
that
reason
taught
us
the
words
days
apart
we
spent
two
to
three
days
talking
about
every
noun
we
knew
being
droite
side
of
the
street
before
we
learned
gauche
google

be
careful
re
unintentionally
biasing
your
results
especially
in
diglossic
environments
people
are
really
aware
of
their
languages
and
of
what
they
think
that
outsiders
expectations
might
be
if
you
ask
an
asturian
how
often
do
you
use
this
bable
word
he
might
say
rarely
even
though
he
uses
it
every
day
just
because
he
thinks
that
important
university
person
will
think
lesser
of
him
if
he
admits
speaking
that
uneducated
farmers
language
instead
of
good
spanish
or
you
ask
a
catalan
whose
language
is
strongly
influenced
by
spanish
slang
do
you
say
this
catalanism
or
that
castillanism
and
he
will
choose
the
catalanism
for
fear
of
being
labelled
uncatalan
i
have
no
idea
how
to
work
around
this
problem
but
please
be
aware
of
this
phenomenon
when
you
plan
your
methods
it
can
affect
your
study
so
much
you
might
want
to
look
into
the
methodology
of
speech
geography
eg
the
atlas
lingistique
de
la
france
or
a
comparable
spanish
work
these
researchers
never
asked
do
you
call
this
thing
this
or
that
but
rather
how
do
you
call
this
thing
show
a
picture
and
this
childlike
approach
secured
the
validity
of
the
results
swamswum
has
largely
replaced
swimmed
do
you
mean
the
reverse
the
point
isnt
that
its
socially
acceptable
the
point
is
that
it
should
be
socially
acceptable
most
linguists
understand
that
for
the
common
person
to
respect
you
you
need
to
speak
in
a
respected
accent
the
point
is
that
this
need
to
change
yourself
to
appear
intelligent
is
a
bunch
of
bullshit
that
shouldnt
be
the
norm
hopefully
a
real
linguist
will
turn
up
and
explain
this
problem
a
bit
as
for
avoiding
it
i
find
immersingworking
beforehand
with
the
specific
l2
that
i
need
gets
my
head
in
the
right
space
and
eliminates
this
kind
of
other
l2
dropin
effect
to
a
reasonable
degree
so
i
try
and
avoid
switching
between
l2s
in
any
quick
succession
that
was
a
very
good
suggestion
i
think
korean
is
gaining
momentum
on
this
status
due
to
propagation
of
korean
dramas
and
music
however
english
does
enjoy
this
fad
across
many
countries
within
reach
philippines
india
and
outside
the
anglosphere
south
korea
china
mainly
due
to
economic
opportunities
in
the
philippines
codeswitching
in
the
native
language
and
english
has
been
a
sign
not
just
of
economic
status
but
also
academic
and
cultural
prestige
however
at
the
expense
of
relegating
proficiency
in
the
native
languages
much
poorer
than
ever
while
also
failing
to
promote
full
proficiency
in
english
were
a
terrible
case
of
mass
diglossia
particularly
in
the
urban
areas
its
because
the
inventor
was
european
and
was
working
within
european
immigrant
neighborhoods
your
gotcha
isnt
one
id
say
it
cant
be
done
for
the
simple
reason
that
particles
are
usually
elements
that
behave
like
nothing
else
in
a
language
they
are
usually
a
place
holder
for
stuff
linguist
dont
fully
understand
or
that
doesnt
want
to
behave
like
the
rest
of
categories
so
thats
that
on
the
other
hand
here
is
a
spanish
particle
dizque
it
is
a
sort
of
kind
of
evidential
with
many
different
uses
it
can
behave
like
an
adverb
like
an
adjective
and
like
nothing
of
the
sort
it
can
be
used
to
a
indicate
that
a
statement
is
something
i

im
from

deep
south
though
and
i
have
a
rather
odd
accent
nothing
wrong
with
physicists
linguist
stuck
in
a
physicists
body
would
this
not
require
that
whole
insulated
online
communities
with
internally
accepted
spelling
variations
would
have
to
exist
to
some
extent
i
always
wondered
if
there
was
a
name
for
this
you
hear
it
a
lot
in
bollywood
movies
indian
with
english
obviously
not
russian
that
would
be
weird
yet
another
possibility
is
that
both
of
the
towns
have
different
settlement
patterns
and
histories
despite
being
close
together
if
one
town
has
had
lots
of
immigrants
from
another
area
and
the
other
hasnt
then
the
dialects
could
have
maintained
this
difference
possibly
reinforced
by
my
first
point
i
wonder
if
this
might
be
the
explanation
idaho
falls
was
originally
established
as
a
railroad
town
named
eagle
rock
shelley
was
settled
by
a
mormon
pioneer
named
john
f
shelley
most
of
the
early
shelley
settlers
arrived
at
the
same
time
and
the
same
isnt
true
of
idaho
falls
there
was
also
a
fair
number
of
swedish
immigrants
that
arrived
in
the
1880s
and
1890s
settling
in
shelley
and
a

switch

for

from

you
dont
understand
and
think
about
the
task
i
expect
the
code
could
be
cracked
after
a
while
some
parts
would
be
easy
some
would
be
virtually
impossible
languages
vary
in
how
ordered
they
are
id
imagine
that
more
regular
languages
would
be
easier
to
crack
english
is
very
irregular
but
this
doesnt
really
make
sense
as
youd
need
something
other
than
the
dictionary
to
check
answers
against
and
the
dictionary
doesnt
really
contain
the
langauge
as
such
it
would
certainly
help
in
the
task
of
deciphering
the
language
to
have
a
dictionary
thats
not
the
point
of
linguistics
but
yeah

seriously
dude
read

with

accent
you
can

the
real
trouble
with
black
english
all
im
doing
is
encouraging
you
to
think
about
where
the
standard
comes
from
who
enforces
it
and
what
it
means
in
any
case
there
is
a
difference
dear
new
readers
of
the
sub
between
yes
it
sucks
that
in
many
cases
you
need
to
speak
standard
english
to
get
a
good
job
and
be
taken
seriously
but
thats
how
the
world
works
and
we
also
think
its
unfair
and
arbitrary
and
man
uptalk
is
so
annoying
and
unprofessional
most
of
us
incline
towards
the
first
i
found
this
entirely
too
funny
thank
you
so
it
is
both
then
no
harm
done
id
say
supposedly
would
be
its
english
equivalent
i
know
of
the
occasional
person
in
my
area
who
pronounce
them
as
pellow
and
melk
as
well
as
marshmellow
i
myself
say
gether
for
gather
and
rether
for
rather
i
dont
think
this
necessarily
has
to
do
with
the
ncvs
were
definitely
out
of
its
range
its
not
the
good
here
its
the
like
today
the
like
seems
completely
natural
at
the
time
the
ad
was
aired
it
caused
quite
the
controversy
the
grammatically
correct
version
would
have
used
as
the
use
of
the
colloquial
not
broadly
accepted
as
grammatical
like
ended
up
giving
winston
a
lot
of
press
and
any
press
is
good
press
and
the
slogan
stuck
i
think
what
clint
and
ultravoices
meant
is
that
if
you
were
to
take
a
part
of
a
normal
speakers
speech
edit
out
all
of
the
discourse
markers
and
then
play
it
back
it
would
sound
extremely
stilted
and
unnatural
personally
i
use
them
to
buy
my
brain
some
time
to
catch
up
with
my
mouth
especially
when
im
discussing
something
complex
or
thoughtful
i
also
constantly
pause
and
check
with
my
audience
if
theyre
still
on
the
same
page
as
me
as
a
courtesy
probably
not
oh
yes
i
meant
including
proper
translation
of
v
c
ae
etc
eg
pronounce
c
how
they
pronounce
ch
and
sc
as
sch
etc
then
itl
be
spot
on
my
comment
was
based
on
how
italian
is
spoken
considering
most
spelling
is
closest
to
latin
and
being
relatively
phonetical
thus
retaining
similar
phonetics
with
obvious
mutations
which
you
outlined
its
just
a
representation
of
rl
in
norwegian
and
swedish
this
is
very
common
with
many
consonants
technically
those
that
can
be
dental
i
think
especially
in
swedish
see
the
chart
and
explanation
at
for
instance
cohabiting
monkeys
in
the

the

yes
and
no
the
goal
of
a
chomskyan
approach
is
still
to
describe
and
identify
the
limits
of
grammars
to
account
for
what
is
ungrammaticalungenerated
in
a
principled
manner
there
was
never
anything
in
the
chomskyan
approach
that
devalued
the
study
of
lesserknown
languages
however
describing
the
surface
patterns
of
a
language
is
not
sufficient
in
the
chomskyan
approach
since
it
doesnt
distinguish
what
is
unsaid
from
what
is
unsayable
a
fieldworker
who
tries
to
document
understudied
languages
and
analyze
them
using
the
framework
of
generativism
will
avail
themselves
of
both
observational
data
and
of
intuitions
of
native
speakers
with
intuitions
being
key
but
not
necessarily
the
only
source
of
information
to
distinguishing
production
errors
from
grammatical
structures
but
the
goal
is
always
to
find
if
the
tools
we
have
already
developed
to
account
for
the
patterns
we
see
in
the
languages
we
know
can
account
for
unstudied
patterns
in
languages
we
are
exploring
for
the
first
time
in
a
way
thats
fruitful
and
allows
us
to
make
predictions
cataloging
surface
patterns
is
a
good
and
useful
activity
we
could
not
do
linguistics
without
that
but
a
chomskyan
approach
demands
an
analysis
that
goes
beyond
description
and
toward
explanation
in
any
language
that
is
studied
the
only
valid
response
is
to
tell
her
in
a
dignified
manner
absolutely
which
reminds
me
can
anyone
defend
to
me
why
adverbs
are
a
class
extremely
of
extremely
convenient
cant
modify
verbs
fast
of
run
fast
cant
modify
adjectives
the
only
definition
i
seem
to
find
is
the
negative
one
modifiers
to
nonnouns
someone
beat
me
to
it
from
what
he
reports
it
seems
like
there
is
in
fact
something
to
everetts
paper
the
correlation
does
seem
to
be
real
even
when
controlling
for
family
relations
they
do
point
however
at
a
clear
problem
verbobject
order
and
the
relationship
between
vo
and
an
orders
are
better
predictors
of
altitude
than
whether
the
language
has
ejectives
or
not
and
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
an
explanation
for
how
air
pressure
or
vaporization
might
influence
the
word
order
yet
another
source
of
possible
error
that
i
found
is
that
the
google
system
for
getting
elevations
might
not
be
so
great
for
some
35
languages
i
got
9999
elevations
im
not
sure
if
it
is
because
of
how
i
got
these
or
because
google
earth
doesnt
provide
accurate
elevations
for
some
places
on
earth
this
makes
me
even
more
skeptical
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
and
that
its
just
a
compound
sentence
because
its
a
sentence
consisting
of
several
independent
clauses
but
no
dependent
clauses
according
to
wiktionary
its
from
the
middle
english
gadden
the
author
of
the
paper
caleb
everett
is
posting
in
the
comments
section
awesome
thanks
edit
whoa
230is
it
a
textbook
hmm
if
you
have
a
recommendation
thats
a
bit
more
accessible
pricewise
that
would
be
better
though
i
will
keep
this
one
in
mind
for
one
day
sentence
2
is
not
compound
it
is
simple
the
verb
in
sentence
2
is
compound
but
the
sentence
is
simple
as
in
the
yorkshire
dales
logically
there
must
be
hills
but
it
is
the
dales
that
are
famous
have
you
tried
writing
to
the
authors
actually
even
alberta
has
a
few
frenchspeaking
neighborhoods
and
both
of
those
provinces
have
french
immersion
school
programs
where
all
subjects
except
english
if
its
taught
are
taught
in
french
i
dont
know
but
does
that
give
one
star
to
damn
and
two
to
jesus
christ
and
crap
because
i
never
got
in
trouble
for
saying
jesus
or
christ
as
a
kid
and
i
was
allowed
to
say
crap
much
earlier
than
damn
i
think
that
these
are
pretty
obviously
different
if
you
think
about
power
dynamics
in
englishspeaking
societies
being
a
dick
isnt
particularly
offensive
partially
because
dicks
are
seen
as
powerful
or
something
that
explanation
seems
a
bit
ad
hoc
to
me
and
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
correct
to
say
that
they
are
not
particularly
offensive
in
the
region
where
i
am
now
they
rank
high
on
the
offensiveness
scale
probably
below
cunt
but
above
twat
the
important
thing
to
note
is
that
it
is
not
an
argument
it
is
an
explanation
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
its
not
a
matter
if
whether
it
should
be
taboo
it
is
taboo
and
you
observe
correctly
that
the
manner
in
which
such
taboos
are
propagated
is
very
much
a
feedback
loop
carrots
are
oranges
in
denmark
apparently
you
would
have
to
say
piraha
isnt
a
language
which
it
clearly
is
that
is
of
course
only
if
you
believe
everett
and
not
the
several
other
people
who
have
done
fieldwork
with
the
pirah
thats
an
interesting
example
i
think
it
works
thank
you
yes
in
fact
theres
a
term
for
this
spelling
pronunciation
i
dont
have
any
examples
outside
of
english
but
often
is
the
best
example
for
english
fair
enough
i
think
science
daily
does
more
good
than
harm
because
it
always
links
to
original
sources
and
still
appeals
to
a
lay
audience
such
as
myself
in
the
subject
of
linguistics
is
salmon
ever
pronounced
with
the
l
ive
never
heard
it
pronounced
so
i
think
its
important
to
keep
in
mind
too
that
handwritten
manuscripts
of
the
period
were
heavily
illustrated
and
ornate
making
it
easy
to
mistake
a
lowercase
i
for
a
stray
line
eh
as
far
as
i
can
see
only
february
has
any
potential
to
vary
based
on
which
side
of
the
atlantic
you
are
on
i
agree
especially
since
the
us
is
listed
as
english
speak
when
it
has
no
official
language
the
vowel
system
of
wari
has
been
analyzed
as
being
very
asymmetrical
fourfive
front
vowels
and
the
only
back
vowel
being
o
wat
it
is
de
facto
the
offical
language
there
is
no
de
jure
offical
language
could
you
tell
those
of
us
who
dont
know
asl
what
she
is
saying
obviously
the
germanic
tribes
knew
plants
but
dishes
kitchens
and
cheese
im
not
so
sure
if
those
2
are
dialects
of
arabic
then
hebrew
is
an
arabic
dialect
as
well
how
does
that
compare
to
other
languages
spanishitalianportugese
for
instance
not
that
i
know
these
languages
but
i
have
witnessed
often
enough
that
spanish
and
italian
speakers
just
conversed
each
using
their
own
language
yup
yup
back
in
the
day
slavic
had
singular
dual
and
plural
in
addition
in
some
of
these
languages
using
numbers
means
youll
be
declining
the
noun
being
counted
into
the
genitive
case
anything
5
and
over
usually
takes
genitive
plural
but
14
usually
take
the
genitive
singular
edit
haha
definitely
wiped
out
on
this
comment
cherrynubcakes
has
a
much
better
explanation
of
what
i
was
trying
to
say
i
always
felt
that
a
bosom
of
bluefooted
boobies
should
be
a
collective
noun
but
alas
it
is
not
so
though
since
most
of
those
nouns
are
arbitrary
anyway
its
not
such
a
stretch
to
just
start
using
it
comes
up
in
conversation
more
than
you
would
think
quaternary
does
seem
to
exist
and
to
mean
what
one
would
think
it
would
same
with
quintenary
im
sort
of
at
a
loss
as
to
what
to
search
for
six
though
this
seems
to
miss
the
point
this
is
not
a
question
of
orthography
and
the
random
assignment
of
a
graphical
character
the
question
is
surely
why
do
such
diverse
sounds
emerge
from
a
single
phoneme
in
the
parent
language
if
thats
not
over
simple
consider
rare
rare
and
raro
for
instance
this
is
the
best
iphone
screenshot
i
have
ever
seen
or
ever
will
see
if
i
were
clevererer
or
felt
like
lying
i
would
have
taken
full
credit
as
such
today
was
apparently
not
a
good
day
for
such
subterfuge
which
my
boardgaming
peers
should
be
thankful
of
or
for
example
lovely
rita
by
the
beatles
give
us
a
wink
and
make
me
think
of
you
you
might
be
right
or
the
owner
is
trying
to
save
their
own
ass
just
saying
the
fact
that
it
was
a
teenager
that
complained
wellteenagers
get
fired
from
jobs
all
the
time
she
could
get
her
15
minutes
of
fame
and
lose
nothing
really
she
says
she
is
looking
for
a
new
job
my
point
is
they
are
language
police
not
police
noun
but
as
in
they
police
verb
and
enforce
whatever
they
hell
it
is
they
are
supposed
to
be
doing
i
would
be
astounded
to
hear
if
english
and
french
started
declining
seriously
again
although
i
suppose
that
russian
does
decline
rather
extensively
in
learning
quirks
of
etymology
like
this
in
english
chicken
refers
to
the
animal
and
the
resultant
meat
however
the
meat
of
a
cow
is
beef
this
is
because
norman
aristocracy
in
england
spoke
french
and
were
the
only
ones
on
average
who
could
afford
such
a
meat
thus
we
get
the
french
word
beouf
for
the
meat
and
the
lowly
saxon
word
cow
for
the
animal
since
all
can
see
the
animal
but
only
some
can
eat
it
i
love
that
well
i
discovered
that
there
might
be
more
to
think
about
with
respect
to
language
in
high
school
when
i
realized
taking
french
that
there
was
a
logic
to
how
sentences
worked
i
started
reading
a
bit
on
linguistics
and
came
across
some
writeups
of
universal
grammar
for
the
layperson
and
started
trying
to
read
mark
barkers
wonderful
book
the
atoms
of
language
which
i
didnt
manage
to
complete
until
i
was
in
college
but
it
gave
me
a
sense
that
there
was
more
out
there
my
undergrad
university
didnt
have
a
linguistics
program
but
i
wound
up
majoring
in
cognitive
science
which
had
an
interdisciplinary
blend
of
psychology
computer
science
and
philosophy
courses
if
i
wasnt
an
academic
linguist
i
mightve
been
a
philosopher
instead
in
some
nearby
possible
world
i
discovered
that
the
real
interest
of
mine
was
gaining
some
insight
into
minds
i
always
remained
interested
in
linguistics
but
the
interest
was
because
the
theories
were
interesting
and
said
interesting
things
about
human
cognition
i
still
dont
think
languages
or
the
sociological
and
cultural
baggage
that
go
with
them
are
very
interesting
by
themselves
whats
interesting
are
what
languages
can
teach
us
about
how
our
capacity
for
language
works
i
inherited
a
love
of
it
from
my
mother
can
we
consider
danish
and
norwegian
azeri
mostly
latinbased
nowadays
in
azerbaijan
but
persian
in
iran
bahasa
indonesia
used
to
be
separated
from
bahasa
melayu
since
the
former
used
a
dutchbased
latin
orthography
now
the
separation
is
based
on
lexical
and
syntactic
conventions
promoted
by
both
the
indonesian
and
malaysian
governments
more
poetically
stuhlgewitter
welp
thats
creepy
i
quite
like
this
hypothesis
it
thoroughly
describes
what
ive
been
saying
to
describe
english
for
some
time
now
namely
that
ive
referred
to
it
as
a
bastard
language
im
quite
surprised
that
id
never
thought
of
it
actually
being
a
creole
though
im
sure
i
would
have
arrived
at
that
conclusion
at
some
point
and
found
said
hypothesis
thank
you
for
speeding
up
the
process
you
really
dont
think
its
relevant
that
one
of
those
words
has
an
entirely
distinct
history
of
oppression
and
subordination
of
an
entire
group
of
people
attached
to
it
youd
wish
theyre
germans
i
think
calling
a
woman
a
cunt
is
oppressive
and
subbordinating
i
think
guys
has
become
genderless
its
not
uncommon
to
refer
to
a
group
of
100
women
as
guys
that
doesnt
apply
to
the
singular
guy
though
irish
may
seem
pretty
bad
but
when
you
get
used
to
the
complex
phonology
and
elliptical
system
it
gets
much
easier
in
nz
we
start
answers
with
yeah
nah
or
nah
yeah
or
yeah
nah
yeah
heaps
it
fills
in
the
thinkingofaresponsegap
1
wanna
go
to
the
dairy
2
yeah
nah
its
a
bit
of
a
walk
ay
we
americans
say
yeah
no
sometimes
but
not
as
a
filler
more
like
a
i
acknowledge
your
statement
but
no
developmental
psychologist
vygotsky
suggested
that
the
first
stage
of
eg
reading
is
that
you
cant
do
it
at
all
then
you
enter
a
stage
where
you
can
read
with
help
the
zone
of
proximal
development
or
scaffolding
then
finally
you
reach
a
stage
where
you
can
read
by
yourself
the
critical
part
is
that
this
is
a
process
that
works
from
the
outside
in
and
that
you
reach
the
final
stage
by
internalizing
the
instructions
and
guidance
you
received
in
the
scaffolding
stage
theres
lots
of
research
that
corroborates
that
something
like
this
happens
so
its
not
surprising
that
you
would
read
in
a
voice
that
isnt
yours
since
youre
reading
with
the
help
of
others
in
everyday
speach
song
is
any
piece
of
music
that
is
not
improvised
not
to
say
that
songs
cant
be
improvised
but
i
wouldnt
say
someone
played
a
song
if
i
just
saw
them
improvising
a
bit
songs
are
like
abstract
concepts
that
musicians
can
realize
my
intuition
is
that
its
fine
to
call
anything
a
song
that
was
composed
or
could
realistically
accompany
singing
even
if
no
singing
was
present
after
all
when
we
talk
about
that
new
insert
band
song
we
arent
just
talking
about
the
vocals
but
the
entire
piece
if
the
piece
was
written
to
not
include
any
singing
then
instrumental
is
more
proper
i
suppose
but
i
dont
see
a
problem
with
the
phrase
instrumental
song
even
here
though
i
would
only
probably
call
something
an
instrumental
piece
if
the
context
was
such
that
musical
pieces
normally
are
accompanied
by
vocals
like
in
rock
music
for
example
beethoven
has
a
lot
of
nice
songs
though
on
a
more
practical
note
etymology
rarely
gives
us
exact
definitions
the
german
word
for
song
lied
comes
from
the
same
root
as
the
english
word
laud
since
way
back
songs
were
often
used
to
give
praiseworshipetc
someonething
that
said
there
is
no
problem
understanding
how
even
a
song
which
harshly
criticizes
someone
is
still
a
lied
most
english
speakers
are
probably
not
even
aware
of
the
connection
between
song
and
sing
you
are
more
likely
to
find
frankish
burgundian
ripuarian
influences
than
old
englishanglosaxon
also
norse
in
brittany
and
elsewhere
there
are
several
groups
of
words
with
some
common
phonetic
themes
wgu
as
in
guerre
gant
guepe
skesqu
knivcanif
actually
frisian
is
considered
to
be
closely
related
with
english
and
therefore
west
germanic
whereas
danish
is
a
north
germanic
language
the
wikipedia
article
doesnt
mention
danish
as
a
part
of
the
ingvaeonic
languages
apparently
north
germanic
languages
including
danish
or
its
predecessor
have
only
been
spoken
in
east
denmark
and
northern
europe
of
course
at
that
time
at
least
thats
what
the
map
says
also
this
area
speaking
north
frisian
is
not
actually
located
in
denmark
the
border
is
farther
in
the
north
on
this
map
even
though
the
border
has
shifted
farther
down
in
the
meantime
it
is
still
located
in
germany
i
cant
really
tell
you
if
frisian
is
mutually
intelligible
with
low
german
or
danish
since
i
dont
live
in
that
area
i
hadnt
hear
of
this
sounds
interesting
do
you
have
sources
only
because
lager
is
the
standard
beer
in

i
would
assume

a

that

hmmm
well
im

obviously

darwin

i
refuse

to

simply
as

hopefully
the

its
truly
sad
when

dies
out
just
look
at
the
way
english

in
many
parts
of

for

some

alan
from

there
are
no
ancient
tribes
over
10000
years
old
anywhere
on
earth
ancient
man
did
not
crawl
out
of
africa
whatever
happened
to
our
school
lessons
that
mesopotamia
was
the
cradle
of
civilization
the
fertile
crescent
im
just
an
old
anthropologist
so
what
do
i
know
i
only
studied
this
african
culture
from
1980
to
1986
so
i
probably
dont
know
that
much
truth
is
we
do
not
know
exactly
where
the
first
man
and
woman
came
from
but
we
do
know
now
according
to
advances
in
the
study
of
dna
that
we
are
all
related
to
the
first
man
and
woman
we
also
know
that
our
first
parents
did
not
evolve
from
monkeys
the
game
is
over
for
darwinian
evolutionists
of
which
i
used
to
be
one
the
truth
was
hard
to
face
but
the
bible
is
true
after
all
dave
from

says
darwin
was
an
idiot
who
has

you
want
to
remember
evolution
is
just
a
theory
its
not
called
the
theory
of
evolution
for
nothing
one
question
i
have
ok
apes
to

right
ok
it
takes
millions

the

question
where
are
all
the

walking
about
now
did
evolution
stop
apes
are
now
staying
apes
evolution
is
stupid
its
for
people
who
are
too
arrogant
to
accept
there
may
be
a
intelligence
higher
than
ours
even
scientists
admit
the
chances
of
life
forming
on
its
own
is
the
same
as
getting
2
dice
and
throwing
6000
sixes
on
the
trot
and
that
is
hopeful
as
even
in
lab
conditions
they
have
never
ever
been
able
to
create
a
life
form
from
inanimate
matter
its
nonesense
go
buy
a
bible
before
its
too
late
a
cousin
of
mine
noticed
both
our
mothers
do
that
and
she
especulated
it
could
be
because
of
our
grandmother
i
didnt
have
noticed
it
before
but
now
i
do
she
refers
to
herself
indistinctively
when
talking
to
me
using
the
first
person
men
vaig
a
comprar
im
going
shopping
or
the
third
person
la
mare
sen
va
a
comprar
mothers
going
shopping
i
dont
know
if
its
something
that
is
common
with
catalan
speakers
or
some
peculiarity
within
my
family
worth
noticing
is
that
this
doesnt
happen
when
she
has
to
talk
to
me
in
spanish
montreal
has
always
been
an
anglophone
city
i
guess
i
cant
argue
for
the
past
but
montreal
is
66
francophone
only
13
anglophone
i
dont
know
if
youve
ever
been
to
montreal
but
the
dont
use
as
much
english
as
you
think
for
longer
filler
one
of
my
japanese
instructors
used
to
repeat
several
times
quickly
after
the
first
long
one
indeed
the
very
two
eminent
biologists
that
coauthored
with
chomsky
on
their
landmark
2002
paper
hauser
and
fitch
have
since
gone
on
to
speculate
about
the
emptiness
of
fln
2010
2010
perhaps
hauser
was
eminent
and
so
his
opinion
matters
argument
from
authority
but
after
several
accusations
over
the
years
he
was
finally
caught
fabricating
data
was
fired
from
harvard
and
has
left
academia
in
shame
i
work
in
one
of
his
3
major
areas
and
lets
just
say
that
no
one
believes
his
work
anymore
some
of
it
may
be
true
but
no
one
can
tell
nih
is
actually
funding
a
few
people
with
similar
animal
colonies
to
replicate
some
of
his
work
fitch
is
a
good
solid
midcareer
scientist
sure
but
hardly
eminent
so
what
evidence
do
you
have
that
generativists
dont
have
competence
in
functionalist
literature
most
of
the
staggering
misunderstandings
seem
to
me
to
be
the
other
way
around
for
instance
the
whole
debate
about
pirah
not
having
recursion
a
summary
here
and
that
if
this
were
true
this
fact
disproving
ug
to
clarify
fieldwork
directed
towards
language
documentation
thats
not
very
nice
affrication
refers
to
the
realization
of
a
stop
as
an
affricate
eg
t
ts
spirantization
refers
to
the
realization
of
a
stop
as
a
fricative
eg
t
s
or
both
are
possible
types
of
lenition
which
broadly
speaking
refers
to
the
process
by
which
a
sound
becomes
more
sonorous
wow
that
was
both
barely
legible
and
very
ironic
edit
yup
hes
a
troll
sorry
for
downvoting
you
noble
troll
there
is
no
creator
of
my
standard
my
standard
is
what
is
readable
and
what
follows
rules
and
im
a
20
year
old
woman
why
on
earth
are
you
bringing
gender
stereotypes
into
this
the
actual
stereotypes
associated
with
your
style
of
writing
arent
old
the
average
person
in
my
generation
associates
an
incompetence
with
your
style
of
writing
and
you
are
not
using
a
linguistics
feature
you
are
randomly
capitalizing
and
misusing
tense
there
is
no
standard
and
no
common
rules
to
it
its
not
linguistics
its
laziness
i
was
hoping
for
someone
to
say
something
about
ye
we
already
screwed
up
trying
to
represent
the
on
one
other
occasion
to
contrast
this
in
japanese

would
be
written
using
chinese
numerals
as
it
is
pronounced
juusan
literally
tenthree
ive
just
recently
begun
studying
japanese
and
found
it
strange
that
their
1119
was
recorded
that
way
once
you
reach
20
it
follows
the
same
format
as
it
would
in
english
twoten
twenty
if
anyone
could
elaborate
it
would
be
much
appreciated
as
a
competitive
scrabble
player
in
two
languages
i
would
like
to
add
that
there
are
about
25
times
more
acceptable
2
to
15letter
words
in
spanish
than
there
are
in
english
im
going
to
store
this
away
not
least
of
all
because
of
the
transcriptions
given
for
each
sound
effect
good
stuff
i
hear
meese
a
lot
in
this
way
as
well
as
boxen
for
techy
people
talking
about
computer
boxes
logos
word
the
language
maps
do
include
transcaucasia
though
basque
never
fails
if
she
spoke
perfect
english
with
flawless
grammar
than
the
linguists
would
have
to
at
least
show
that
she
was
grammatically
consistent
with
her
system
of
choice
in
southeastern
italian
dialects
its
something
along
the
lines
of
mr
mir
which
comes
from
latin
merum
please
note
i
said
dialects
and
not
dialect
because
there
can
be
variants
like
mru
miru
or
miru
mjeru
etc
i
dont
know
all
of
them
so
i
cant
help
you
further
a
new
version
of
the
map
has
been
uploaded
that
fixed
errors
added
northern
saami
and
added
etymologies
you
can
see
the
previous
version
of
the
map
here
i
love
this
question
i
try
to
ask
questions
about
it
to
the
people
i
know
who
have
it
its
very
interesting
suggestive
of
some
separation
of
the
two
in
the
brain
sort
of
tangential
but
it
needs
to
be
said
i
am
a
linguist
and
i
think
that
the
word
literally
is
totally
fine
to
be
used
to
describe
a
figurative
thing
i
would
say
it
is
also
a
type
of
modelling
as
it
increases
exposure
to
the
language
it
would
not
be
detrimental
i
believe
the
hanen
program
program
for
parents
of
young
children
with
language
delay
good
evidence
base
uses
this
technique
and
others
to
facilitate
language
growth
found
a
review
with
open
access
if
anyone
was
interested
i
imagine
that
would
put
anyone
off
but
its
not
really
what
forensic
linguistics
deals
with
sure
if
its
relevant
to
have
samples
of
writing
from
such
forums
to
compare
to
qdocs
it
can
be
analyzed
but
not
for
lifestyle
and
buying
habits
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
a
strategy
more
for
marketing
firms
leaning
more
towards
psychologypsycholinguistics
also
everything
i
wrote
in
my
earlier
post
is
concerning
authorship
analysis
which
is
just
one
facet
of
forensic
linguistics
the
field
also
concerns
itself
with
false
confessions
threat
analysis
dialect
analysis
etc
maybe
it
is
the
use
of
a
question
mark
to
show
uncertainty
within
a
statement
lol
i
made
a
joke
sorry
from
a
somewhat
different
angle
the
languages
we
see
are
the
languages
that
are
produced
by
possible
pathways
of
change
thus
the
languages
we
dont
see
arent
necessarily
unlearnable
but
might
just
not
have
any
or
many
diachronic
pathways
leading
to
them
technically
nearly
every
linguistic
change
if
most
people
were
aware
of
them
they
wouldnt
happen
mostly
of
course
unlike
most
things
in
linguistics
this
has
actually
been
empirically
tested
see
yes
of
course
from
there
was
yet
another
for
somebody
who
like
pirx
was
carrying
a
suitcase
over
the
shinywhite
fields
rose
dawn
on
asphalt
went
with
silvery
vapors
their
lights
shone
red
before
while
i
agree
that
the
community
should
be
a
central
component
of
documentation
efforts
talk
of
saving
languages
is
problematic
as
it
frames
the
community
and
speakers
as
passive
actors
if
they
wanted
to
keep
the
language
around
then
there
should
be
a
linguist
to
help
them
do
it
and
thats
fantastic
because
our
values
all
align
if
they
dont
then
the
best
we
can
do
is
document
what
we
can
and
keep
it
in
an
archive
we
do
not
know
better
and
we
should
not
presume
to
know
better
neither
do
i
agree
that
the
publication
of
her
fieldwork
memoir
exists
at
the
expense
of
the
speakers
in
fact
i
find
these
accounts
of
life
in
the
field
and
of
the
experience
helpful
for
the
documentation
community
overall
students
are
very
interested
in
matters
like
these
and
barring
attendance
at
infieldcolang
or
icldc
there
is
little
opportunity
for
them
to
interface
with
people
who
are
actually
doing
this
work
i
havent
read
the
memoir
but
i
do
know
the
author
and
she
is
not
one
to
draw
attention
to
herself
in
the
way
you
imply
shes
a
good
linguist
and
a
responsible
fieldworker
to
be
fair
people
elsewhere
in
the
americas
usually
consider
themselves
americanos
not
americans
the
words
dont
mean
the
same
thing
since
amrica
in
spanish
and
portuguese
refers
to
a
single
continent
that
in
english
is
considered
two
continents
and
america
in
english
refers
to
the
us
which
seems
to
get
under
the
skin
of
the
nonnative
englishspeakers
who
object
to
the
usage
of
the
english
word
its
prescriptivism
across
languages
your
word
doesnt
mean
the
same
thing
as
my
word
but
it
should
fwiw
i
dont
think
ive
ever
heard
germans
complain
about
not
being
called
dutch
i
regretfully
didnt
take
any
pictures
of
the
information
but
remember
it
saying
it
was
legit
cuneiform
here
are
a
few
more
pics
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
more
about
them
i
cant
tell
you
what
it
says
but
you
can
learn
a
lot
about
the
language
and
its
alphabet
here
turkish
greek
and
bulgar
influences
on
the
language
also
when
we
were
standardizing
our
language
the
old
case
system
was
mostly
dated
and
we
picked
some
dialect
that
sounded
like
something
sort
of
in
the
middle
the
way
some
words
are
pronounced
like
simple
pronouns
or
whatever
was
just
a
result
of
a
bunch
of
pronunciation
shifts
that
occurred
in
the
dialect
that
was
chosen
to
be
the
standard
for
example
some
dialects
sound
more
like
russian
others
sound
less
so
like
russian
this
is
a
gross
oversimplification
but
it
illustrates
a
point
edit
also
much
of
the
vocabulary
is
similar
just
looking
at
that
list
most
of
the
words
past
the
first
section
are
similar
or
the
same
to
russian
the
ones
that
arent
are
either
similar
to
other
slavic
countrys
words
have
another
word
in
bulgarian
thats
similar
to
the
russian
words
is
archaic
but
a
bulgarian
would
understand
it
or
just
doesnt
exist
the
contempt
of
each
is
different
cracker
doesnt
reinforce
unequal
power
structures
you
rock
why
do
you
think
it
makes
more
sense
on
the
other
hand
many
nonslavic
countries
have
names
ending
in
ia
eg
albania
nigeria
algeria
syria
so
i
dont
expect
its
a
slavic
borrowing
in
english
oh
and
btw
herzegovina
doesnt
end
in
ia
heh
i
just
realized
the
acronym
for
the
online
etymology
dictionary
probably
isnt
a
coincidence
either
its
a
typo
or
youre
from
somewhere
where
a
comma
is
used
as
a
decimal
point
ie
europe
your
surface
realiser
looks
really
cool
ill
have
to
explore
that
a
bit
especially
is
sausage
machines
are
involved
hahaha
please
do
because
it
is
fun
and
tag
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything

united

is
not
used
in
the
gettysburg
address
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
usthat
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotionthat
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vainthat
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedomnd
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
if
the
biggest
consideration
with
poetry
is
rhyming
which
isnt
always
the
case
even
in
english
i
think
anecdotally
theres
a
point
more
flexible
word
order
which
many
ie
languages
with
casemarking
have
including
russian
i
think
allows
more
flexibility
with
what
word
goes
where
to
make
the
rhyme
or
maybe
the
meter
too
work
i
guess
it
could
help
but
it
seems
a
silly
comparison
to
make
why
judge
a
language
by
how
well
it
fits
into
particular
english
literary
norms
i
think
a
bigger
part
though
is
use
of
suffixes
with
these
you
can
sometimes
cheat
when
youre
rhyming
and
use
the
consistent
grammatical
suffix
to
make
more
words
rhyme
in
english
by
adding
s
for
plurals
giving
you
a
free
rhyming
sound
imagine
being
able
to
do
that
with
whole
syllables
and
in
more
contexts
hebrew
can
do
this
with
possessive
suffixes
or
even
direct
object
suffixes
in
classical
hebrew
an
example
is
the
weird
kind
of
creepy
song
mimaamakim
from
the
depths
here
whose
verses
are
hebrew
theres
a
part
which
i
think
is
amharic
without
transcribing
the
whole
thing
pretty
much
all
the
lines
rhyme
using
the
ending
ekh
or
ayikh
these
are
singular
feminine
2ndperson
suffixes
for
possessives
the
first
one
for
singular
nouns
the
latter
for
plural
and
the
latter
is
also
a
feminine
secondperson
ending
of
hebrews
declined
prepositions1
essentially
the
song
rhymes
a
ton
of
syllables
with
similar
meanings
and
functions
without
repeating
words
for
instance
the
songs
rhymes
are
some
words
repeat
plural
nouns
with
singularfeminine2nd
person
possessives
or
certain
prepositions
that
are
in
the
same
person
alayikh
to
you
beyadayikh
in
your

beoznayikh
in

mitachtayikh
from
under

your

singular

possessives
beshuvekh
in
your
return
tschokekh
your
laugh
darkhekh
your
path
chalonekh
your
window
beytekh
your
house
all
use
the
same
or
similar
meaning
but
since
its
an
affix
youre
not
repeating
words
or
using
homonyms
that
forms
literally
every
rhyme
in
the
whole
thing
and
there
are
no
words
that
rhyme
with
it
that
dont
use
that
system
this
isnt
always
used
in
hebrew
rhyming
music
this
song
rhymes
though
its
often
just
a
final
phoneme
rather
than
a
whole
syllable
but
only
one
rhyme
uses
that
at
all
and
velevavi
and
begani
which
both
use
the
i
firstperson
singular
possessive
suffix
many
others
rhyme
but
dont
use
that
at
all
but
again
this
is
a
very
shallow
way
to
judge
poetry
and
the
languages
therein
but
i
suspect
thats
what
its
based
on
edit
also
in
hebrew
and
some
other
languages
that
conjugate
with
suffixes
any
verbs
in
the
same
person
and
tense
will
rhyme
in
hebrew
firstperson
singular
pasttense
verbs
always
end
in
ti
giving
you
an
easy
rhyme
without
duplicating
words
the
following
started
as
a
footnoteexplanation
of
hebrew
prepositionpronouns
but
developed
into
a
musingwonderingdiscussion
of
different
analysis
of
hebrew
prepositions
read
it
at
your
own
risk
if
youre
looking
for
clarification
its
enough
to
say
that
prepositions
are
usually
prefixes
and
all
of
them
merge
with
pronouns
into
one
word
that
isnt
just
the
combination
of
the
two
of
themits
one
unit
thats
not
separable
1
to
explain
for
the
unfamiliar
in
hebrew
prepositions
are
prefixes
and
with
pronouns
they
form
a
distinct
inflected
preposition
which
cannot
be
broken
into
two
words
imagine
having
thatcha
but
no
that
you
for
instance
le
is
to
but
to
me
is
li
to
you
is
lekhalakhlakhemlakhen
depending
on
gender
and
number
these
exist
for
all
prepositionpronoun
combinations
because
hebrew
has
a
preposition
marking
direct
objects
et
pronouns
only
exist
in
their
naked
forms
when
theyre
the
subjects
of
verbs
these
forms
have
some
patterns
but
in
many
cases
the
pronoun
is
unique
when
combined
with
the
particular
prepositiontheyre
not
just
the
prefix
and
the
pronoun
thrown
together
a
similar
system
exists
in
celtic
languages
such
as
irish
scottish
gaelic
and
welsh
interestingly
this
and
other
phenomena
mostly
the
fact
that
prepositions
are
bound
morphemes
have
cause
a
few
people
to
analyze
hebrew
as
having
a
system
of
case
declension
with
a
nominative
thats
unmarked
and
prefixmarking
of
roughly
10
cases
thats
exceptionless
for
nouns
and
marks
for
definiteness
and
distinct
forms
for
every
pronoun
in
every
case
personally
i
think
its
overly
complex
and
doesnt
mesh
well
with
hebrew
grammar
more
widely
but
its
an
interesting
analysis
there
is
some
overlap
between
the
two
hebrew
does
have
some
of
the
properties
that
make
case
affixes
distinct
from
prepositions
lending
credence
to
the
analysis
actually
pretty
much
all
of
them
im
gradually
being
convinced
maybe
its
a
transitional
form
someone
smarter
come
help
me
analyze
and
if
hebrew
developed
a
fullon
case
system
with
a
significant
number
of
cases
itd
be
a
fantastic
example
of
a
language
change
cycle
hebrew
lost
its
case
declensions
thousands
of
years
ago
but
theoretically
depending
on
analysis
could
gain
one
back
again
by
making
morphemes
bound
and
eventually
into
affixes
the
scottish
have
a
term
bawbag
which
is
a
little
more
obvious
but
is
also
a
pejorative
term
a
possible
example
is
yiddish
it
has
lots
of
hebrew
loanwords
because
it
was
the
speakers
literary
and
religious
language
even
though
they
didnt
speak
it
this
create
semantic
distinctions
surrounding
religion
other
languages
wouldnt
have
some
of
which
have
been
carried
over
to
english
for
instance
the
words
seyfer
and
bukh
both
mean
book
but
the
first
one
implies
some
sort
of
religious
text
because
its
a
hebrew
word
i
think
there
are
two
words
for
die
one
hebrew
and
one
germanic
similar
distinctions
get
moved
over
to
jewish
english
theres
a
distinction
between
praying
and
daveningthe
former
is
general
the
latter
is
specifically
jewish
and
between
reading
and
leyning
has
the
diversity
of
culture
in
america
affected
the
development
of
american
english
the
biggest
thing
is
probably
the
loanwords
which
come
from
all
sorts
of
sources
and
vary
with
the
cultural
background
of
the
speaker
i
dont
know
if
it
counts
as
an
idiom
but
ive
noticed
that
the
word
for
female
dog
is
a
swear
in
a
lot
of
languages
dutch
teef
english
bitch
french
chienne
russian
sorry
i
was
referring
to
the
syntax
article
a
prepublication
draft
can
be
found
here
if
you
dont
have
access
admittedly
ive
worked
a
lot
harder
at
getting
the
sounds
right
in
languagesnever
took
singing
lessons
what
exactly
do
you
think
linguists
do
just
speculate
about
language
and
then
magically
have
their
opinions
published
in
major
journals
isnt
the
dual
in
slovenian
a
more
recent
innovation
something
like
wetwo
ive
enjoyed
the
history
of
english
podcast
its
not
straight
up
linguistics
but
quite
fascinating
nonetheless
link
try
reading
books
on
philosophy
im
a
native
english
speaker
and
these
types
of
books
are
the
only
ones
that
consistently
expand
my
vocabulary
example
may
be
too
hard
but
you
may
be
able
to
find
something
of
interest
from
that
genre
there
is
definitely
a
limit
to
how
many
languages
a
person
can
learn
alone
for
the
fact
that
you
need
time
to
actually
speak
these
languages
but
this
limit
is
around
78
for
a
normal
person
now
lets
take
your
example
a
person
in
congo
will
learn
their
tribal
language
and
swahili
as
mother
languages
so
the
school
system
needs
not
be
involved
most
people
also
speak
english
to
a
certain
degree
and
there
is
constant
contact
with
the
language
which
would
make
teaching
it
and
learning
it
relatively
easy
learning
two
languages
in
school
is
perfectly
doable
you
wont
get
native
proficiency
but
youll
be
perfectly
able
to
communicate
so
in
summary
4
languages
is
perfectly
manageable
for
a
normal
person
there
are
even
communities
that
have
around
7
or
8
languages
with
only
200
speakers
sadly
for
political
reasons
tribal
languages
are
seen
as
a
bad
thing
in
congo
there
is
little
one
can
do
about
that
several
posts
a
week
would
be
excessive
yes
but
if
you
want
to
do
a
cross
post
of
rspecgram
content
every
so
often
until
you
get
the
sub
off
the
ground
i
think
that
would
be
ok
i
find
it
quite
surprising
that
youre
form
hamilton
and
dont
find
that
people
from
out
west
speak
differently
ill
admit
the
difference
is
subtle
but
for
me
ontarian
it
is
definitely
noticeable
wow
out
of
the
two
hockey
turns
out
to
be
legit
as
luck
would
have
it
just
after
i
posted
this
i
went
to
a
family
reunion
and
i
brought
up
the
subject
everyone
on
my
maternal
grandmothers
side
said
they
used
these
two
words
when
they
were
young
halfway
through
i
checked
this
post
on
my
phone
then
disbelievingly
told
everyone
what
the
experts
had
to
say
so
i
pronounce
weather
and
whether
the
same
also
the
h
is
not
pronounced
in
this
mystery
word
i
wrote
the
h
to
distinguish
the
word
from
want
i
guess
bulanguagearia
you
may
want
to
fix
your
autocorrect
there
otherwise
great
stuff
theres
no
way
youll
ever
mispronounce
when
reading
out
loud
a
word
youve
never
heard
before
that
was
true
only
in
brazilian
portuguese
before
the
abhorrent
orthographic
agreement
with
portugual
then
we
had
and
ia
to
guide
us
but
even
then
we
had
the
differential
diacritical
signs
which
sure
meant
pronounciation
was
not
as
straightforward
as
we
were
used
to
think
with
german
its
got
to
be
the
compound
nouns
theyre
really
awesome
though
not
unique
to
german
swedish
etc
has
it
too
sort
of
i
mean
technically
there
is
no
limit
to
how
long
a
word
can
be
in
german
so
the
longest
word
is
in
theory
infinitely
long
the
word
referring
to
the
beef
law
was
just
the
longest
word
in
official
use
and
so
it
was
also
recognized
as
the
longest
word
but
now
that
its
dropped
out
of
official
use
there
is
no
reason
to
recognize
it
as
a
word
distinctly
from
all
the
other
infinite
combinations
of
ideas
that
could
potentially
be
made
into
words
of
the
same
length
or
longer
in
german
ad
infinitum
isnt
loaned
you
idiot
when
someone
uses
it
theyre
directly
quoting
a
latin
phrase
what
you
all
are
saying
is
the
equivalent
of
someone
saying
a
la
mode
pronouncing
it
wrong
and
then
defending
their
mispronunciation
by
saying
well
we
took
the
phrase
and
made
it
english
its
absolutely
retarded
and
every
single
one
of
you
is
an
idiot
it
was
still
in
haywood
county
up
by
max
patch
crabtree
i
worked
at
the
76
station
at
the
i40
exit
and
got
my
mail
at
a
po
box
in
lake
junaluska
we
group
subfamilies
based
on
when
they
diverge
from
one
another
we
judge
this
based
on
shared
features
and
shared
innovations
if
for
instance
4
of
the
10
daughter
languages
of
some
language
all
exhibit
a
particular
feature
like
phonologically
s
h
it
might
be
simpler
for
us
to
assume
that
those
4
languages
were
all
one
language
which
underwent
that
particular
change
once
rather
than
that
all
4
languages
underwent
the
same
change
four
independent
times
we
realize
upon
doing
this
sort
of
work
that
its
almost
never
as
simple
as
one
parent
language
splitting
into
10
daughters
but
rather
splitting
into
two
based
on
some
innovation
and
then
each
of
those
daughters
splitting
again
on
some
other
features
etc
there
are
times
of
course
when
different
languages
will
independently
undergo
the
same
changes
similarities
arent
always
evidence
for
historical
relationships
but
we
weigh
the
evidence
based
on
how
many
shared
features
we
see
how
usualunusual
each
of
those
features
are
globally
etc
and
then
make
a
determination
that
way
if
you
read
my
other
comment
youll
see
that
this
is
more
or
less
what
i
answered
the
other
guygal
the
thing
is
every
other
moth
or
so
someone
comes
up
with
yet
another
unsubstantiated
claim
for
the
relatives
of
basque
and
blow
their
unpublished
research
out
of
proportion
in
the
press
which
really
gets
annoying
it
seems
natural
to
prescribe
a
gender
to
many
things
in
the
world
calling
a
ship
her
eg
so
i
imagine
that
somehow
that
just
became
the
norm
and
when
new
words
entered
a
gender
was
many
times
just
picked
now
let
me
put
it
simple
for
all
around
again
it
was
not
an
assertion
i
made
but
simply
my
personal
impression
that
proto
dravidiantamil
link
in
the
etymology
of
sanskrit
gurukuru
voice
was
much
more
plausible
linguistic
and
historical
explanation
given
in
the
excerpt
from
the
message
board
i
posted
than
a
purely
noncoherent
pie
root
heavy
burden
which
makes
no
sense
whatsoever
and
it
bodes
with
a
query
of
mine
not
a
study
not
a
hypothesis
which
explored
the
meaning
of
two
related
taboo
words
in
slavic
languages
with
some
references
in
latin
and
finno
ugric
languages
that
kind
of
support
that
link
to
protodravidiantamil
root
and
maybe
the
idea
peddled
by
the
multidisciplinary
study
linked
above
is
such
link
viable
i
dont
fucken
know
and
im
not
aware
if
any
of
the
existing
linguistic
migration
theories
can
give
a
sensible
answer
left
the
field
long
long
ago
and
my
schooling
was
in
applied
linguistics
anyway
so
everybody
chill
the
fuck
down
i
dont
fucken
care
what
you
think
you
know
or
what
is
believed
to
be
seen
quite
a
lot
of
batshit
crazy
speculations
in
the
field
already
tldr
a
protodravidiantamil
link
in
the
etymology
of
sanskrit
guru
seems
and
is
much
more
plausible
to
me
as
such
explanation
also
makes
sense
when
exploring
slavic
taboo
words
it
also
gives
some
credibility
to
the
idea
of
common
linguistic
megafamily
roots
in
my
personal
opinion
expressed
in
a
recent
study
link
provided
is
there
such
link
and
could
it
fit
in
one
of
the
several
linguistic
migration
theories
i
dont
fucken
know
thats
all
folks
now
you
can
chill
the
fuck
down
over
and
out
im
a
linguist
interested
in
programming
so
just
to
be
nitpicky
avestan
was
an
old
eastern
iranian
language
written
with
a
cursive
aramaic
derived
alphabet
old
persian
was
the
western
iranian
language
written
with
syllabic
cuneiform
at
the
behistun
inscription
as
you
mentioned
the
indoiranian
peoples
are
made
up
of
indic
and
iranian
peoples
surprising
i
know
each
obviously
have
a
number
of
subgroups
even
in
ancient
times
avestan
though
is
just
an
umbrella
term
for
the
language
of
the
zoroastrian
scriptures
of
which
there
are
several
varieties
avestan
doesnt
refer
to
any
specific
ethnicity
though
so
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
call
an
ethnic
group
avestan
people
but
as
other
users
have
mentioned
there
are
multiple
versions
of
these
epics
or
slightly
different
versions
this
was
also
the
case
when
the
old
testament
was
being
committed
to
writing
for
the
first
time
the
scribes
though
instead
of
choosing
a
single
version
as
authority
wrote
multiple
versions
smashed
together
this
is
why
we
get
multiple
versions
of
genesis
from
wikipedia
the
creation
narrative
is
made
up
of
two
stories
roughly
equivalent
to
the
two
first
chapters
of
the
book
of
genesis
there
are
also
multiple
versions
of
noahs
story
one
of
which
says
he
took
2
of
each
animal
while
the
other
says
he
took
7
of
all
the
clean
animals
scholars
have
identified
4
sources
for
the
old
testament
elohist
yahwist
priestly
and
deuternomistic
these
are
based
on
style
and
the
word
thats
used
for
god
so
theres
an
example
of
something
similar
happening
really
how
would
you
get
ocean
and
sugar
then
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
sfront
vowel
combination
im
not
sure
how
you
could
be
influenced
by
a
word
you
had
never
heard
before
what
captivated
my
attention
is
the
complexity
of
the
script
what
do
you
mean
its
28
characters
for
arabic
anyway
add
a
few
for
persian
and
a
few
more
for
urdu
a
few
of
which
have
some
minor
variations
the
fact
that
it
doesnt
rely
on
standard
representations
can
you
explain
what
you
mean
here
standard
representations
of
what
what
is
the
standard
and
who
sets
it
the
words
seem
more
like
abstract
drawings
than
combinations
of
simple
symbols
are
you
talking
about
calligraphic
styles
just
like
how
we
have
tons
of
fonts
in
english
there
are
tons
of
styles
of
arabic
script
beyond
typesets
youre
likely
to
find
in
newspapers
can
anyone
explain
how
this
form
came
to
be
was
able
to
flourish
and
how
it
is
taught
to
members
of
the
society
do
you
mean
the
persoarabic
script
or
do
you
mean
a
particular
form
like
the
nastaliq
script
coming
from
an
english
language
speaker
it
seems
so
much
more
complex
and
vibrant
than
our
boring
simplistic
writing
system
we
have
26
symbols
give
or
take
in
an
alphabet
all
of
which
have
variant
forms
compare
capital
and
lowercase
with
countless
writing
styles
they
have
28
symbols
give
or
take
in
an
abjad
with
countless
writing
styles
it
sounds
like
you
just
like
foreignness
of
it
which
theres
nothing
wrong
with
mind
you
but
i
would
caution
against
letting
its
exoticism
tempt
toward
an
orientalist
approach
to
the
languages
and
cultures
minor
question
which
your
post
produced
for
me
did
you
use
new
zealand
as
a
random
example
or
because
there
is
actually
evidence
for
language
death
occurring
there
im
a
kiwi
myself
and
studied
language
death
within
my
linguistics
university
papers
id
never
heard
anything
of
such
a
death
occurring
im
assuming
youd
be
talking
about
the
moriori
of
the
chatham
islands
who
were
all
but
exterminated
i
guess
we
have
lost
that
language
but
i
was
under
the
impression
it
was
simply
a
dialect
of
maori
anyway
thanks
for
your
post
it
was
very
insightful
edit
also
the
chatham
islands
werent
officially
new
zealand
soil
until
the
1840s
around
10
years
after
the
extermination
but
that
is
just
splitting
hairs
relevant
wikiepdia
page
and
a
quote
from
it
the
grammars
of
some
languages
divide
the
semantic
space
into
more
than
three
persons
the
extra
categories
may
be
termed
fourth
person
fifth
person
etc
such
terms
are
not
absolute
but
can
refer
depending
on
context
to
any
of
several
phenomena
some
languages
including
among
algonquian
languages
and
salishan
languages
divide
the
category
of
third
person
into
two
parts
proximate
for
a
more
topical
third
person
and
obviative
for
a
less
topical
third
person
the
obviative
is
sometimes
called
the
fourth
person
the
term
fourth
person
is
also
sometimes
used
for
the
category
of
indefinite
or
generic
referents
which
work
like
one
in
english
phrases
such
as
one
should
be
prepared
or
people
in
people
say
that
when
the
grammar
treats
them
differently
from
ordinary
thirdperson
formscitation
needed
the
socalled
zero
person12
in
finnish
and
related
languages
in
addition
to
passive
voice
may
serve
to
leave
the
subjectreferent
open
zero
person
subjects
are
sometimes
translated
as
one
but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
english
language
constructions
involving
one
eg
one
hopes
that
will
not
happen
are
rare
and
could
be
considered
to
be
expressing
an
overly
academic
tone
while
finnish
sentences
like

are
recognizable
to
and
even
used
by
young
children
that
seems
preposterous
didnt
dante
consider
himself
a
speaker
of
latin
meaning
he
acknowledged
his
florentine
vernacular
as
a
descendant
sort
of
of
classical
latin
im
pretty
sure
early
romance
speakers
were
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
their
vernacular
was
a
bastardized
in
their
view
version
of
latin
changed
by
time
they
are
both
on
the
reading
list
for
austronesian
but
i
am
particularly
fond
of
blust
2009
the
austronesian
languages
and
lynch
ross
and
crowley
2002
the
oceanic
languages
first
of
all
is
blust
2009
is
pretty
crucial
piece
in
austronesian
linguistics
and
what
is
even
better
is
that
l337sas
posted
a
link
to
the
whole
thing
in
pdf
the
oceanic
languages
discusses
exactly
what
the
title
implies
what
makes
up
the
oceanic
languages
who
had
contact
with
who
etc
and
then
it
has
a
mess
of
sketches
so
you
can
check
it
out
pretty
legit
i
like
to
read
some
stuff
about
the
american
indian
languages
too
if
you
have
am
academiaedu
account
willem
de
reuse
has
about
40
free
papers
on
there
he
has
worked
on
central
siberian
yupik
and
western
apache
he
is
very
detailed
and
has
some
neat
theories
i
also
like
mariane
mithun
and
she
has
several
free
papers
googleable
that
are
addressing
nonie
languages
unless
a
language
with
only
absolute
direction
also
incorporates
direction
into
a
lot
of
other
areas
of
the
language
motion
verbs
for
example
it
would
not
make
things
impossible
but
could
possibly
be
difficult
depending
on
how
it
is
representing
throughout
the
language
it
reminds
me
of
the
characters
of
disneys
beauty
and
the
beast
chip
la
taza
fifi
el
plumero
el
armario
no
name
even
if
chip
is
a
male
child
he
is
still
una
taza
just
like
in
real
life
juan
a
male
can
be
una
persona
i
took
a
break
and
did
one
masters
than
took
another
break
then
did
another
in
a
different
field
the
references
thing
was
kinda
bugging
me
when
i
was
applying
and
since
i
didnt
feel
i
had
anyone
from
my
undergrad
that
could
vouch
for
me
i
took
a
random
chance
and
asked
a
somewhat
well
known
prof
within
my
specialty
if
hed
consider
writing
a
letter
despite
never
having
had
me
in
class
it
was
a
hail
mary
that
happened
to
work
out
and
i
never
said
there
was
but
that
point
seems
to
have
been
tragically
missed
how
do
you
pronounce
that
sticky
confection
made
of
partially
burnt
sugar
often
used
to
top
sundaes
no
i
would
say
that
north
american
dialects
tend
to
say
mzlm
while
other
dialects
tend
toward
mzlm
id
argue
youd
only
see
the
midcentral
schwa
when
someone
is
saying
moslem
mzlm
indeed
thanks
i
was
thinking
about
that
but
the
alphabets
seem
to
be
different
between
persian
and
tajik
im
not
sure
she
would
be
able
to
read
persian
do
you
think
she
would
just
out
of
curiosity
do
you
know
of
any
good
introductory
reading
about
either
language
this
is
something
that
ive
recently
developed
an
interest
in
but
im
not
really
sure
of
where
to
look
erstwhile
may
be
fossilized
but
voracious
and
queer
certainly
arent
consider
where
your
parents
come
from
when
you
look
at
these
maps
my
parents
are
from
ohio
and
queens
and
i
was
raised
in
north
jersey
so
i
use
a
lot
of
terms
that
are
from
north
jersey
but
my
pronunciation
is
all
messed
up
i
never
get
my
exact
region
on
these
maps
although
i
did
get
south
jersey
a
couple
of
times
which
was
nice
but
my
hometown
and
my
parents
hometowns
were
all
in
the
red
garbage
can
is
the
one
that
goes
on
the
street
for
the
garbage
men
to
pick
up
trash
can
is
the
one
inside
the
house
thats
what
i
grew
up
with
anyway
as
an
adult
im
likely
to
use
either
one
interchangeably
or
like
you
just
leave
off
the
can
and
talk
about
the
garbage
or
the
trash
i
dont
think
its
that
unique
dutch
structuur
huis
gebouw
educatie
scholing
opleiding
there
are
also
tons
of
words
with
only
a
latin
version
in
english
and
both
a
germanic
word
and
latin
word
in
dutch
or
other
germanic
languages
for
example
some
words
that
appeared
in
your
comment
variety
varieteit
verscheidenheid
synonym
synoniem
evenwoord
to
exist
existeren
bestaan
i
just
dont
think
its
reason
enough
for
a
more
varied
word
use
also
romance
languages
can
have
such
pairs
on
old
one
direct
latin
borrowing
spanish
la
llave
la
clave
i
had
to
choose
other
as
i
say
rubbish
barrels
im
pretty
sure
i
picked
this
up
from
my
dad
they
swim
this
is
the
sort
of
information
you
should
include
in
the
beginning
of
a
post
if
id
just
given
you
an
example
of
head
marking
but
you
didnt
know
what
a
head
was
it
would
make
no
sense
to
you
i
dont
know
if
youre
on
your
phone
posting
from
class
or
something
but
consider
taking
an
extra
minute
to
put
some
thought
into
a
post
next
time
please
ill
start
from
scratch
addressing
this
in
a
toplevel
post
only
among
exchange
students
and
alles
klar
in
the
north
of
germany
well
i
suppose
i
would
rather
be
told
now
than
to
have
difficulty
finding
a
job
later
yes
i
think
my
issue
is
more
with
the
situation
itself
supervisors
naturally
should
give
the
best
advice
possible
part
of
the
issue
is
that
jobs
are
so
scarce
you
dont
want
to
wear
any
one
hat
exclusively
but
surely
thats
why
a
grammar
is
so
great
writing
a
grammar
is
evidence
of
understanding
of
phonetics
phonology
syntax
morphology
lexicography
etc
not
to
mention
that
not
all
grammars
cover
everything
equally
you
can
still
specialise
within
your
grammar
i
have
one
colleague
writing
a
grammar
which
includes
a
deep
description
of
the
grammar
of
space
in
the
language
another
doing
something
similar
with
three
participant
events
and
another
with
nominal
classification
so
you
havent
been
yet
no
i
thought
id
be
long
gone
by
now
but
weve
had
problems
getting
ethics
approval
and
ordering
equipment
neither
of
which
are
yet
resolved
ive
been
told
everyone
sucks
their
first
time
working
on
a
tone
language
but
im
not
sure
if
they
suck
this
much
i
still
need
to
think
about
it
talk
to
advisors
etc
i
think
youre
stressing
too
much
i
spoke
to
a
linguist
whos
been
working
on
the
same
language
for
over
twelve
years
and
she
admitted
she
still
often
cant
tell
whether
a
given
consonant
is
retroflex
or
not
im
sure
youll
get
better
phrases
that
dont
exist
in
english
followed
by
pictures
accompanied
by
phrases
that
exist
in
english
pretty
damn
well
no
were
not
bound
to
get
a
kick
out
of
these
because
theyre
silly
at
best
and
misleading
at
worst
fun
game
got
500
points
my
first
try
maltese
sounded
completely
different
than
i
expected
kai
von
fintel
but
also
see
barbara
partee
thank
you
what
is
bc
im
reading
it
as
british
columbia
but
that
sounds
wrong
really
cool
game
as
a
german
i
was
amused
bcs
in
the
german
part
i
heard
sth
about
the
saarland
there
was
actually
a
french
phrase
savoir
vivre
though
it
was
not
pronounced
very
french
random
processes
must
have
something
to
do
with
it
the
mean
formant
frequencies
of
a
vowel
category
changing
with
each
generation
just
due
to
one
generation
sampling
from
the
earlier
ones
they
learn
from
ie
they
take
a
random
walk
over
generations
yes
thats
true
100
i
like
to
think
the
state
of
the
english
language
depended
on
who
was
trying
to
take
over
britain
at
that
moment
in
history
im
a
native
cantonese
speaker
and
a
linguist
and
the
vocabulary
is
not
99
the
same
nor
is
the
grammar
heres
one
quick
example
from
cantonese
a
comprehensive
grammar
by
matthews
and
yip
where
they
compare
the
aspect
system
sorry
for
the
bad
picture
another
example
of
grammar
differences
is
the
passive
voice
in
mandarin
you
can
leave
out
the
agent
ta
bei
da
le
he
was
hit
but
cantonese
requires
a
dummy
agent
if
none
is
explicit
keuh
bei
yunyeh
da
jo
he
was
hit
by
someonething
this
sounds
a
lot
like
singapores
mother
tongue
approach
which
seems
pretty
successful
out
of
curiosity
do
you
know
how
english
and
other
foreign
languages
fit
into
taiwans
national
education
program
i
will
add
another
point
is
usually
associated
with
yn
questions
there
are
other
particles
that
are
used
for
both
interrogative
and
noninterrogative
purposes
for
example
1
means
you
should
go
while
2
means
you
are
going
right
of
course
these
two
sentences
carry
very
different
intonations
when
spoken
but
since
theres
not
much
we
can
do
to
mark
intonation
in
writing
punctuation
helps
edit
erm
typos
why
do
they
hate
the
term
gaelic
i
dont
think
that
really
counts
what
vocabulary
does
a
3
year
old
have
its
totally
different
from
a
man
in
his
70s
he
is
telling
a
heroic
tale
with
very
specific
features
or
runs
that
you
wouldnt
hear
in
everyday
speech
part
of
the
reason
thinks
ostler
is
that
in
an
odd
way
latin
is
actually
easier
to
learn
than
living
languages
you
dont
need
to
be
able
to
follow
a
conversation
in
it
you
just
need
to
be
able
to
read
says
ostler
and
that
is
a
point
seconded
by
mary
beard
professor
of
classics
at
cambridge
university
one
of
the
pleasures
of
latin
is
that
you
dont
have
to
speak
it
and
of
course
not
many
people
do
it
is
charming
that
the
finns
broadcast
news
in
latin
it
doesnt
hurt
but
its
not
why
you
learn
latin
says
beard
i
do
wonder
how
many
people
even
get
to
learn
to
read
latin
well
as
a
latin
tutor
it
pains
me
to
see
people
most
definitely
including
me
struggle
over
reading
cicero
without
nary
a
problem
despite
years
of
learning
in
both
school
and
university
this
would
be
unacceptable
for
someone
who
has
learned
german
for
the
same
period
of
time
i
would
imagine
there
are
very
few
people
in
the
world
today
who
can
sit
down
with
a
book
of
the
aeneid
and
a
cup
of
tea
and
read
it
all
in
a
day
with
toilet
breaks
etc
in
between
all
chinese
are
intj
germans
act
like
libras
i
have
experience
with
dialect
coaching
which
involves
the
use
of
phonetics
as
well
as
other
linguistic
properties
to
coach
teach
the
correct
way
to
speak
in
a
certain
accent
dialect
in
that
sense
i
would
consider
it
as
linguistically
prescriptive
also
oye
listen
and
if
anyone
cares
for
the
translation
of
his
last
filler
what
was
i
saying
oh
cool
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
example
i
was
looking
for
do
you
know
what
is
causing
the
change
also
which
old
dictionary
did
you
mean
to
link
to
according
to
eric
partridges
book
book
of
usage
and
abusage
1954
ant
is
the
phoneticaly
and
philologically
logical
shortening
of
am
not
i
think
you
forgot
about
de
and
dem
meaning
you
singular
formal
subject
and
object
i
know
op
didnt
want
layman
speculation
but
since
were
off
topic
ill
throw
in
my
speculation
anyway
i
de
and
dem
can
be
confused
with
i
de
and
dem
so
the
capitalisation
may
be
to
avoid
that
confusion
perhaps
someone
has
actually
studied
this
or
the
capitalisation
of
the
german
sie
and
can
explain
the
reason
for
it
edited
translation
of
de
and
dem
one
reason
is
that
we
call
them
dialetti
so
dialects
come
more
natural
than
variety
or
other
words
secondly
a
language
can
be
called
dialect
when
it
is
a
satellite
of
another
language
upon
which
the
speakers
have
bestowed
a
higher
prestige
finally
dialects
can
be
seen
in
two
fashions
1
historical
latin
sicilian
dadson
2
sociolinguistical
italian
sicilian
siblings
that
said
i
think
italian
dialects
qualify
i
think
i
say
washroom
to
people
i
dont
know
as
well
even
at
their
homes
for
example
if
i
were
to
go
to
my
bosss
place
for
dinner
but
we
had
a
quite
formal
relationship
i
might
say
washroom
but
if
my
friend
had
just
moved
to
a
new
place
ill
definitely
ask
where
the
bathroom
is
maybe
washroom
makes
it
easier
to
pretend
that
im
just
going
to
go
wash
my
hands
but
with
bathroom
well
obviously
im
not
going
to
go
bathe
so
the
idea
of
what
i
am
actually
doing
is
closer
at
hand
i
dont
mean
to
suggest
that
people
actively
think
of
these
things
but
it
might
be
something
kind
of
lurking
deep
down
in
our
heads
when
we
pick
a
word
to
use
from
what
i
remember
from
my
fla
class
one
book
listed
around
20
different
types
of
bilingualism
depending
on
the
standpoint
of
production
acquisition
age
etc
there
were
simultaneous
sequential
infant
child
adult
balanced
dominant
receptive
heritage
language
compound
coordinate
and
possibly
many
more
bilingualisms
true
bilingualism
would
be
compound
simultaneous
infant
balanced
as
i
see
it
language
changes
it
has
changed
it
is
changing
and
it
will
continue
to
change
theres
no
reason
to
think
without
any
evidence
that
its
changing
any
more
now
than
at
any
other
time
and
no
you
cant
just
say
technology
or
internet
or
globalization
as
if
thats
evidence
enough
when
things
change
the
set
of
things
that
is
correct
whatever
that
means
changes
with
it
if
we
determine
correctness
by
usage
then
to
say
becoming
acceptable
to
use
incorrect
words
is
meaningless
if
its
accepted
and
used
then
its
correct
if
we
determine
correctness
by
some
other
arbitrary
and
fixed
standard
that
definition
is
bound
to
become
increasingly
obsolete
and
is
thus
pretty
useless
diachronically
there
is
no
tipping
point
its
time
to
acquire
a
new
perspective
on
language
change
interesting
do
you
have
any
sense
of
what
the
job
markets
are
like
for
materials
design
or
language
planningpolicy
currently
a
linguistics
undergrad
in
nz
considering
doing
a
phd
in
a
few
years
time
my
main
interests
are
in
phonetics
and
phonology
and
id
like
to
use
that
to
work
in
speechlanguage
therapy
so
i
have
two
questions
what
are
the
best
graduate
programs
in
this
field
and
following
from
that
what
is
the
job
market
like
for
a
doctor
of
speech
therapy
ie
will
i
be
able
to
stay
in
nz
what
is
wrong
with
the
culture
tathaastu
yup
i
found
atlasti
to
be
quite
useful
and
flexible
in
coding
qualitative
data
i
just
copypaste
into
notepad
or
open
it
in
firefox
i
think
you
dont
realize
how
much
progress
you
have
already
made
on
the
problem
are
you
not
able
to
talk
to
your
instructor
about
it
i
dont
think
that
many
of
us
here
will
feel
comfortable
telling
you
the
answer
or
giving
you
strong
hints
since
thats
unfair
to
other
students
in
the
class
i
think
its
generally
assumed
that
syllables
in
all
languages
like
to
be
open
if
possible
modulo
of
course
things
like
a
preference
for
stress
to
fall
on
heavy
syllables
there
are
languages
that
allow
only
cv
syllables
but
as
far
as
we
know
no
languages
that
allow
only
vc
syllables
this
fact
is
interpreted
to
mean
that
theres
a
universal
preference
for
onsets
over
codas
that
is
when
something
can
be
syllabified
as
an
onset
it
must
be
to
be
more
clear
do
you
mean
actual
old
englishbeowulf
middle
englishchaucer
or
early
modern
englishshakespeare
are
there
correlations
of
words
and
their
gender
class
between
languages
yes
there
are
some
correlations
or
is
it
truly
completely
arbitrary
of
which
gender
a
word
ends
up
to
be
also
yes
there
are
some
correlations
but
what
it
ends
up
being
is
mostly
arbitrary
or
conventional
and
also
dependent
on
what
language
youre
talking
about
some
are
more
regular
than
others
for
example
gender
lines
up
pretty
often
in
romance
languages
especially
when
they
use
the
same
word
but
this
definitely
isnt
always
the
case
spanish
speakers
say
la
leche
which
is
feminine
but
french
speakers
say
le
lait
which
is
masculine
even
though
the
word
has
the
same
origin
but
even
within
languages
the
gender
is
not
really
tied
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
just
to
the
word
itself
for
a
more
tothepoint
example
the
gender
of
words
for
genitalia
in
french
are
not
based
on
whose
genitalia
it
is
for
penis
there
is
le
pnis
masculine
le
zizi
masculine
la
bite
feminine
la
queue
feminine
for
vagina
there
is
le
vagin
masculine
le
con
masculine
la
moule
feminine
la
chatte
feminine
so
yeah
the
meaning
of
the
word
is
totally
irrelevant
gender
is
more
closely
associated
with
the
word
itself
english
words
get
borrowed
as
each
gender
somewhat
randomly
its
now
relatively
common
slang
in
france
to
say
la
game
for
the
game
they
decided
it
was
feminine
for
some
reason
the
native
word
is
masculine
on
the
other
hand
le
fun
which
they
have
also
recently
borrowed
is
masculine
even
though
its
pronounced
in
a
way
that
would
make
you
think
its
feminine
tldr
dont
trust
gender
correlations

an
rcolored
vowel

wednesdays
are
awful
funny
not
funny
no
i
think
sapirwhorf
is
almost
a
null
hypothesis
that
linguists
are
constantly
having
to
disprove
language
log
has
some
examples
of
protosapirwhorf
here
heh
one
of
my
professors
is
so
amusedly
annoyed
by
bickerton
he
just
doesnt
stop
lazy
speech
deceptively
correct
according
to
standard
grammar
you
might
want
to
read
up
on
what
linguists
study
as
you
said
its
definitely
hard
to
be
influenced
by
something
that
you
care
absolutely
nothing
about
killing
all
of
them
definitely
didnt
help
either
what
would
those
vowels
be
in
eastern
new
england
thanks
d
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
your
question
are
you
asking
why
english
lacks
things
like
case
and
gender
conjugation
compared
to
other
european
languages
i
already
gave
you
provenance
when
i
mentioned
latin
slow
down
latin
seriously
how
did
latin
losing
conjugation
in
its
transition
to
spanish
around
the
x
century
had
anything
to
do
with
english
as
for
your
question
how
are
you
counting
conjugations
im
really
not
sure
what
youre
aiming
at
here
just
draw
up
a
chart
methodology
will
not
change
much
here
yes
it
will
if
you
count
aspectual
constructions
with
lightverbs
spanish
has
gained
a
freaking
lot
of
these
if
you
dont
why
not
its
also
gaining
object
marking
in
the
verb
which
latin
and
medieval
spanish
lacked
there
are
not
that
many
european
languages
that
had
prolonged
contact
with
english
where
the
other
european
language
formed
a
prestige
language
and
how
about
languages
in
india
and
north
america
australia
africa
and
other
places
besides
europe
there
are
not
that
many
european
languages
that
had
prolonged
contact
with
english
where
the
other
european
language
formed
a
prestige
language
why
is
this
of
any
importance
anyway
the
gist
of
this
whole
thing
is
that
uxiorlanth
said
english
was
losing
its
conjugations
while
other
european
languages
were
not
thats
simply
not
the
case
so
whats
your
point
simply
that
english
is
not
the
only
language
losing
conjugations
sure
thats
true
but
that
was
not
your
original
statement
you
said
languages
in
contact
with
english
latin
was
not
in
contact
with
english
when
it
evolved
into
medieval
spanish
nor
was
proto
germanic
nor
old
church
slavonic
now
if
you
want
go
and
compare
how
many
conjugations
althochdeutsch
and
mittelhochdeutsch
had
with
respect
to
modern
german
are
you
saying
that
the
study
of
conlangs
is
part
of
linguistics
you
would
just
never
say
je
vas
paris
wrong
conj
i
hear
je
vas
from
quebecois
mostly
maybe
a
better
example
would
be
jallons
oh
wait
the
acadians
say
that
maybe
je
vont
are
you
asking
if
prescriptivism
is
the
result
of
formal
language
education
i
would
say
no
ive
been
chastised
for
my
native
asl
grammar
by
people
who
have
never
taken
a
formal
class
in
their
life
i
even
know
a
professor
who
claims
to
scoff
at
prescriptivism
but
will
jump
down
your
throat
if
you
sign
something
that
he
construes
as
english
not
asl
word
order
the
two
grammars
occasionally
overlap
but
some
people
like
to
push
for
more
extreme
adherence
to
asl
rules
based
on
their
cultural
beliefs
and
thats
not
contingent
on
their
education
lets
see
if
anyone
bites
whats
wrong
with
that
example
sentence
not
a
native
speaker
northeasterner
here
in
my
dialect
that
construction
is
used
exclusively
in
that
song
and
would
not
be
considered
wrong
but
would
be
noted
negatively
if
used
in
another
context
these
are
24month
old
toddlers
which
means
they
somehow
have
a
degree
of
exposure
to
a
language
which
was
apparently
mentioned
i
cant
recall
which
study
did
something
on
reaction
among
newlyborns
but
i
hope
someone
can
do
it
crossdemographically
maybe
someone
else
can
provide
you
a
source
i
believe
its
discussed
some
on
wikipedia
if
you
look
up
linguistic
relativity
if
that
helps
but
the
gist
of
it
strong
the
language
you
speak
determines
the
way
you
think
and
places
limits
on
your
possible
thought
processes
weak
the
language
you
speak
affects
the
way
you
think
in
perhaps
quite
minor
ways
op
you
would
probably
be
interested
in
reading
thinking
for
speaking
as
well
sorry
for
not
answering
your
question
here
could
you
recommend
an
article
or
two
which
addresses
this
explicitly
for
a
poor
formallytrained
minimalist
to
peruse
this
sounds
very
interesting

it

but
even

it

there
actually

you
would
have

the

ridiculous
it

it

very
interesting
stuff
i
was
observing
this
in
ontario
so
i
still
have
unanwered
questions
but
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
thanks
very
much
i
learned
spanish
from
children
and
copied
thit
mistake
it
took
me
a
long
while
to
realize
it
is
yo
s
and
not
yo
sabo
this
only
backs
up
l337sass
original
point
about
perspective
a
different
assessment
of
similarity
could
depend
on
what
perspective
you
take
structurally
cebuano
and
spanish
are
extremely
different
however
lexically
cebuano
has
many
spanish
words
for
example
work
is
trabaho
because
these
words
are
borrowings
they
are
eliminated
from
a
historical
comparison
but
there
are
lexical
similarities
this
really
raises
interesting
questions
about
creoles
is
solomonic
pijin
more
like
english
or
an
oceanic
language
as
i
understand
it
the
lexicon
is
heavily
influenced
by
english
while
the
syntax
is
heavily
influenced
by
oceanic
structure
so
is
it
like
english
most
phd
programs
at
least
in
the
us
will
make
you
retake
the
starting
coursework
anyways
so
if
you
do
decide
to
get
a
terminal
ma
first
realize
that
it
wont
be
a
shortcut
or
save
you
time
working
towards
your
phd
if
you
want
some
extra
time
to
work
on
a
project
before
starting
on
a
phd
trajectory
though
it
can
be
worthwhile
especially
if
theres
some
key
person
youll
be
able
to
work
with
i
feel
like
berkeley
actually
most
of
the
schools
named
in
this
thread
will
definitely
be
reach
schools
but
no
harm
in
trying
thanks
for
the
suggestion
northumbrian
dialect
i
would
not
claim
that
all
languages
share
exactly
the
same
amount
of
complexity
in
part
because
how
do
you
even
measure
all
the
complexity
in
an
entire
language
and
it
it
obvious
that
some
languages
are
more
complex
along
a
given
parameter
than
others
eg
more
phonemes
grammatical
gender
vs
no
grammatical
gender
but
youd
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
linguist
who
would
agree
that
some
languages
are
overall
more
complex
than
others
let
alone
that
this
is
patently
obvious
i
hope
so
but
the
moment
i
posted
this
i
got
a
downvote
my
guess
would
be
that
it
became
die
schweiz
because
the
latin
name
is
confratioconjuratioconspiratio
helvetica
i
always
thought
its
because
switzerlands
official
german
name
is
schweizerische
eidgenossenschaft
which
is
feminine
and
schweiz
as
the
shortened
form
kept
the
article
at
least
thats
what
my
german
teacher
told
me
did
you
notice
that
venetian
has
a
lot
in
common
with
spanish
the
only
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
right
now
is
boton
instead
of
pulsante
but
in
general
when
spanish
people
speak
slowly
people
who
understand
veneto
can
pick
up
the
keywords
more
easily
than
other
italians
ps
tolar
for
to
take
also
reminds
me
of
spanish
i
have
a
friend
whos
grandmother
is
from
around
pordenone
the
spanish
in
our
group
were
the
most
able
to
understand
what
she
said
its
not
that
hard
billions
of
students
learn
a
standard
language
in
school
without
being
told
their
native
speech
is
wrong
hell
teachers
never
had
you
or
getting
me
to
drop
my
nonstandard
vocabularythey
never
even
had
to
tell
me
it
worked
naturally
ive
seen
it
used
in
circles
where
linguist
means
language
expert
often
with
defense
or
intelligence
agenciescompanies
in
that
case
triage
involves
identifying
intercepted
communications
that
are
most
vs
least
critical
for
further
analysis
it
can
also
extend
to
analyzing
the
communication
for
the
likelihood
of
the
threat
being
carried
out
but
im
not
sure
what
part
of
that
step
lies
with
the
linguist
and
what
part
lies
with
other
analysts
please
explain
that
second
half
the
bit
about
many
germanic
words
in
modern
usage
in
germanic
languages
not
coming
from
pie
im
a
fledgling
germanicist
so
this
really
intrigues
me
at
least
point
me
in
the
right
direction
for
reading
materials
bitte
this
is
also
the
reason
youd
have
trouble
teaching
aave
as
a
second
dialect
in
the
us
well
as
ive
learned
the
terms
linking
r
refers
to
cases
where
there
was
a
historical
while
intrusive
r
refers
to
cases
that
never
had
so
the
use
of
would
be
linking
in
lore
is
but
intrusive
in
law
is
traditional
rp
used
the
former
but
not
the
latter
x
accent
is
wrong
or
any
other
unthoughtful
idea
that
goes
against
the
egalitaria
of
the
human
language
endowment
it
is
very
possible
to
objectively
be
linguistically
incorrect
what
bugs
me
is
when
people
get
stuck
up
on
what
is
and
isnt
different
languages
that
is
a
political
matter
not
linguistic
one
it
bugs
me
when
linguists
who
should
know
better
write
about
serbocroatian
in
areas
where
they
are
clearly
different
and
only
citing
examples
from
one
of
the
two
where
the
example
is
considered
ungrammatical
in
the
other
standard
would
you
say
that
negation
in
english
is
primarily
expressed
using
the
word
aint
is
a
correct
statement
hell
no
its
true
for
aave
false
for
queens
english
and
silly
for
english
in
its
entirety
well
the
same
holds
for
enclitics
cant
split
a
name
in
serbocroatian
which
is
patently
false
in
croatian
true
for
serbian
and
an
irresponsible
statement
for
serbocroatian
even
though
the
two
are
different
there
is
less
difference
between
standard
croatian
and
standard
serbian
than
between
some
of
the
internal
dialects
still
there
is
no
linguistic
standard
that
can
tell
apart
what
is
a
language
and
what
merely
a
dialect
croatian
is
a
language
because
it
is
declared
to
be
the
official
language
of
republic
of
croatia
just
like
serbian
is
a
language
because
republic
of
serbia
declares
it
to
be
its
official
language
its
that
simple
exactly
the
thorough
kind
of
response
i
was
searching
for
thank
you
for
the
articles
kekabillie
in
hungarian
there
is
no
grammatical
gender
or
even
separate
words
for
heshe
just
one
gender
neutral
third
person
singular
pronoun
this
does
not
seem
to
affect
sexism
at
all
in
their
country
however
sexism
seems
to
right
at
the
same
levels
as
neighboring
countries
in
my
dialect
i
do
not
use
a
short
for
words
ending
in
ing
but
rather
i
every
where
i
can
find
others
on
the
internet
saying
the
same
about
their
dialect
the
response
is
that
we
actually
do
use
but
that
the
illusion
that
we
use
i
has
something
to
do
with
tenseness
which
has
never
made
sense
to
me
ive
tried
as
hard
as
i
can
to
use
in
ing
words
and
it
always
sounds
wrong
to
me
does
this
relate
to
ops
post
how
does
tenseness
relate
to
this
linguistic
competence
like
human
cognition
in
general
is
largely
below
the
level
of
consciousness
if
you
were
doing
fieldwork
on
a
language
and
tried
to
figure
out
its
grammar
by
asking
its
speakers
why
do
you
say
it
that
way
linguists
would
facepalm
by
and
large
speakers
cannot
articulate
why
they
talk
the
way
they
talk
and
when
theyve
grown
up
in
a
rabidly
prescriptivist
culture
which
many
people
have
they
are
likely
to
have
quite
a
bit
of
linguistic
insecurity
and
misconceptions
about
how
language
works
of
course
speakers
feel
confused
and
uncertain
theyve
been
taught
all
their
lives
that
even
intelligent
adults
cannot
be
trusted
to
know
how
to
speak
their
own
native
language
and
most
of
them
have
never
been
taught
real
linguistic
analysis
so
even
if
they
trust
their
judgments
they
dont
know
how
to
explain
them
ill
direct
you
to
the
wikipedia
pages
on
modern
english
and
early
modern
english
is
there
more
to
your
question
than
this
what
do
you
mean
it
seems
to
be
common
knowledge
that
people
who
watch
englishamerican
shows
have
better
accents
in
english
than
those
who
dont
how
do
you
define
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
as
you
said
the
words
are
made
up
so
there
is
no
language
or
native
speakers
you
could
refer
to
edit
i
mean
of
course
you
can
pronounce
them
obviously
wrong
but
you
cant
objectively
decide
what
is
right
it
will
be
always
a
rather
arbitrary
decision
ok
there
are
different
issues
here
people
itd
be
helpful
to
not
confuse
them
my
summary
of
the
questions
we
are
addressing
are
a
what
are
the
words
people
actually
use
when
referring
to
this
language
and
its
cousins
b
who
and
where
are
the
different
terms
used
c
what
do
some
people
feel
about
the
different
usages
d
what
are
more
precise
linguistic
terms
linguists
use
for
this
language
and
why
thank
you
i
very
much
doubt
applied
linguistics
is
immune
just
quieter
about
it
i
dont
know
but
the
english
wiktionary
also
has
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
crimean
tatar
words
with
etymologies
and
full
conjugations
and
all
id
assume
theres
a
bunch
of
serious
enthusiasts
doing
this
how
is
chile
a
neuter
and
feminine
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
the
map
is
just
wrong
chile
is
indeclined
and
as
far
as
its
agreement
a
quick
googling
shows
russians
variously
using
masculine
or
feminine
agreement
eg
is
masculine
nominative
but
is
feminine
genitive
its
possible
that
russians
themselves
are
a
bit
confused
about
what
agreement
to
use
if
the
usage
is
rare
enough
perhaps
a
native
speaker
has
some
insight
eta
somalia
is
similarly
indeclined
and
therefore
ambiguous
but
it
should
be
marked
the
same
as
chile
is
i
was
thinking
this
too
the
romanian
3rd
person
honorific
pronoun
dnul
is
also
ultimately
derived
from
ipse
what
exactly
should
one
does
with
an
r
in
america
come
on
man
there
are
tons
of
us
accents
and
all
treat
them
differently
i
think
you
are
misunderstanding
the
basics
of
this
project
im
not
actively
trying
to
change
my
accent
im
just
trying
to
document
if
anything
changes
and
if
not
you
may
have
watched
too
many
watch
me
do
a
british
misnomer
accent
youtube
videos
this
is
not
the
same
so
jij
is
now
pronounced
like
why
with
a
y
at
the
beginning
and
limburgish
dialects
mostly
i
dont
know
any
inuit
wods
so
im
not
sure
what
youre
trying
to
prove
also
anyone
know
how
the
hell
the
passat
perifrstic
became
a
thing
in
catalan
anar
is
such
a
bizarre
auxiliary
to
use
for
past
tense
in
german
there
are
some
rules
for
some
foreign
words
with
specific
suffixes
taking
certain
gender
from
french
for
example
die
blamage
die
garage
so
the
frenchish
age
is
always
female
das
cello
das
konto
from
italian
are
always
neuter
o
sometimes
when
its
a
foreign
word
with
a
gender
that
gender
is
adopted
for
german
there
are
exceptions
though
it
is
das
notebook
because
the
translation
for
book
is
das
buch
in
german
and
therefore
neuter
the
same
thing
probably
happened
for
job
der
job
is
male
because
the
translation
der
beruf
is
male
sometimes
words
take
a
gender
because
other
words
from
that
group
of
words
have
that
gender
so
it
is
das
marihuana
because
other
drugs
are
neuter
das
kokain
das
heroin
etc
for
some
words
there
isnt
a
real
consensus
though
like
derdas
laptop
der
laptop
is
probably
more
popular
but
das
laptop
is
still
around
for
clothes
it
is
always
das
top
though
other
words
like
der
hype
etc
seem
to
take
a
gender
relatively
randomly
everyone
agrees
that
hype
is
male
though
sooo
there
isnt
a
simple
rule
to
follow
and
it
seems
to
be
kinda
arbitrary
a
lot
of
the
time
are
you
seriously
claiming
that
using
the
pass
simple
is
less
weird
than
using
the
subjonctif
imparfait
no
i
was
claiming
something
of
the
opposite
but
i
assume
you
mistyped
and
meant
to
write
are
you
seriously
claiming
that
using
the
subjonctif
imparfait
is
less
weird
than
using
the
pass
simple
however
that
is
still
a
misrepresentation
of
what
i
wrote
i
said
it
was
weird
for
a
quite
different
reason
the
subjonctif
imparfait
does
not
have
a
specific
tense
value
it
is
called
purely
for
grammatical
reasons
concordance
des
temps
so
it
sounds
very
formal
or
pedantic
but
does
not
change
the
meaning
one
way
or
another
the
pass
simple
on
the
other
hand
while
it
is
less
uncommon
i
am
not
disputing
this
has
taken
the
very
specific
meaning
of
a
narrative
past
so
using
it
when
usage
calls
for
the
pass
compos
is
not
merely
formal
or
pedantic
it
is
arguably
wrong
also
of
course
it
depends
on
the
grammatical
person
the
first
and
second
persons
plural
whether
of
the
pass
simple
or
the
subjonctif
imparfait
are
even
deader
than
the
rest
some
german
scientists
claim
that
capitalization
of
nouns
aids
comprehension
most
likely
marking
nouns
and
other
words
with
different
colors
would
have
a
similar
effect
what
about
a
turnpike
i
was
just
down
in
the
states
and
heard
that
word
seemed
just
like
a
highway
to
me
nasal

i

most
of
those
but
not
quite
all
of
them
correct
me
if
im
wrong
i
realize
i
could
look
them
up
but
its
more
fun
to
discuss
them
with
people
stand

which
is

more
ridiculous
personally
i
wouldnt
say
the
trill
in
is
much
finer
than
in

and
not
as

unless
youre
being
hypercorrect
but
always
there
okay
it
could
be
that
its
just

in

but
i
think
its
sort
of
near
enough
i
feel
like
if
this

were
discovered
today
in
an
african

they
just
diacrit
they
shit
out

never

it
wasnt

until
my

stared
at
me
funny
when
i
said
it
id
argue
its
not
allophony
as
op
said
its
not
predictable
which
voiced

it

whereas
canadian

raising
is
this
is
a
very
good
idea
i
havent
studied
nps
or
dps
yet
though
and
since
the
manual
presents
the
problem
inside
the
discussion
of
the
extended
projection
of
the
clause
i
assumed
that
the
solution
should
be
found
without
tinkering
on
the
dp
umami
isnt
a
basic
taste
in
english
there
were
originally
four
until
we
found
out
the
japanese
had
a
word
for
savory
dont
know
why
we
didnt
go
with
savory
we
might
lack
strict
moods
but
we
can
still
express
those
things
you
know
because
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
simple
unambiguous
definition
in
english
most
native
speakers
think
they
have
a
really
good
idea
what
a
word
it
but
its
heavily
influenced
by
orthography
and
where
spaces
fall
there
are
pages
and
pages
of
text
out
there
of
people
describing
how
they
themselves
use
the
term
word
in
one
particular
text
but
its
almost
always
presented
as
a
sort
of
an
attitude
of
this
isnt
perfect
but
for
our
purposes
here
its
gonna
have
to
be
good
enough
theres
a
book
on
chinese
morphology
that
starts
out
with
this
sort
of
explanation
and
the
author
talks
quite
a
bit
about
why
its
such
a
difficult

to
nail
down
with
chinese

why
do
people
always
think
language
is
all
cut
and
dry
with
clear
black
and
white
rules
and
definitions
for
everything
language
is
complicated
people
thats
why
its
a
discipline
all
its
own
with
people
dedicating
their
lifetime
to
trying
to
sort
out
just
one
tiny
part
of
it
consider
the
neutral
origins
of
the
term
gender
middle
french
gendre
latin
gener
kind
type
group
its
more
accurate
than
the
malefemale
association
we
have
with
the
term
today
it
should
also
help
you
cope
with
for
instance
bantu
languages
that
have
22
noun
classes
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
gendersex
think
of
the
gender
assignments
as
largely
historical
and
arbitrary
that
only
incidentally
coincide
with
actual
gendersex
in
some
languages
in
japanese
maybe
but
if
youre
talking
about
the
english
words
nime
and
manga
youre
wrong
see
also
sake
sombrero
menorah
etc
my
grandma
used
it
very
frequently
she
was
from
a
remote
part
of
county
mayo
in
ireland
it
depends
how
long
you
will
be
working
with
her
the
first
3
years
are
considered
the
most
important
in
terms
of
language
acquisition
but
if
youre
only
spending
2
hours
a
day
4
days
a
week
i
dont
know
if
it
will
have
much
of
a
lasting
effect
hard
to
say
really
yes
im
what
i
guess
other
places
call
a
ta
i
dont
know
what
the
c2
exam
is
but
i
majored
in
french
in
college
and
studied
abroad
and
all
that
the
department
will
give
you
a
test
when
you
apply
to
see
whether
your
level
is
up
to
snuff
well
thats
just
a
side
effect
of
putting
a
group
of
teenagers
together
and
making
them
learn
a
language
my
class
for
whatever
reason
began
inserting
some
variation
of
mojar
into
nearly
every
word
that
was
long
enough
tormentatormoja
parabrisasparamojas
ferrocarrilmojerrocarril
telephonotelemojo
mochillamojilla
language
classes
can
be
fun
thats
interesting
i
wonder
if
programming
languages
or
higher
mathematics
has
similar
effects
in
romanian
as
well
including
illing
oneself
now
that
i
think
about
it
general
linguistics
could
have
things
for
you
i
had
a
seminar
that
analyzed
language
used
in
advertisements
and
i
remembered
that
that
might
be
the
rough
direction
of
what
you
are
aiming
for
there
is
a
lot
in
general
linguistics
about
analyzing
human
speech
and
usage
so
in
conclusion
id
say
go
ahead
and
give
linguistics
a
try
didnt
even
realize
this
was
a
loan
word
makes
sense
though
estacionar
is
pretty
much
nonexistent
in
the
dominican
republic
could
you
be
more
precise
true
but
dialect
levelling
is
getting
rid
of
colloqial
speech
pretty
quickly
guys
i
think
youre
forgetting
the
first
rule
of
linguistics
club
what
makes
you
think
that
things
will
continue
as
they
have
been
indefinitely
its
not
so
much
a
property
of
languages
that
makes
many
die
off
as
its
a
property
of
minority
languages
in
the
current
state
of
affairs
exactly
we
live
in
a
time
of
unprecedented
peace
and
economic
security
relative
to
all
of
human
history
combined
with
technologies
that
enable
globalization
this
has
meant
an
unprecedented
period
of
language
death
however
who
can
predict
that
this
will
persist
linguistic
divergence
depends
heavily
on
the
isolation
of
populations
and
any
number
of
catastrophes
could
change
the
current
trajectory
its
really
not
even
a
linguistic
question

im
wondering
if
there
was
a
kind
of
protoproto
language
that
was
the
forerunner
of
pie
protoafroasiatic
finnougric
protoaltaic
and
others
why
is
it
assumed
that
the
language
families
all
evolved
independently
im
from
central
massachusetts
my
speech
is
basically
a
hybrid
of
eastern
new
england
and
general
american
i
do
have
some
conservative
features
like
not
affricating
tr
and
dr
and
not
reducing
nt
to
n
quite
as
much
as
other
north
americans
do
youre
probably
right
i
have
not
tried
to
analyze
all
the
unstated
rules
that
govern
this
kind
of
usage
but
i
am
sure
that
there
are
rules
in
my
experience
almost
all
ungrammatical
speech
actually
follows
strict
rules
of
which
both
the
speaker
and
the
listener
may
be
unaware
thats
why
i
was
sortof
requesting
that
an
expert
take
a
deeper
look
at
this
emerging
phenomenon
and
try
to
discern
what
the
rules
currently
are
because
i
have
definitely
heard
enough
to
know
that
the
rules
are
not
obvious
probably
not
simple
and
would
probably
help
to
explicate
the
ops
question
especially
if
followed
up
over
a
sustained
period
of
time
as
the
change
continues
to
mature
care
to
explain
hes
credited
i
thought
i
was
just
being
judgey
i
started
to
watch
no
brla
and
could
not
get
into
it
because
that
guy
seems
so
selfrighteous
id
love
to
hear
and
learn
more
about
irish
too
but
not
if
the
price
is
having
to
go
along
with
that
tosser
for
an
example
of
this
check
out
portuguese
where
the
prestige
dialects
tend
to
have
a
greater
amount
of
vowel
reduction
than
the
dialects
with
less
prestige
theres
a
similar
case
with
verbs
like
german
hein
dutch
heten
and
swedish
heta
which
mean
to
be
called
and
are
used
when
giving
ones
name
i
think
this
usage
is
found
in
all
germanic
languages
except
english
but
i
dont
know
of
any
nongermanic
languages
that
have
a
oneword
translation
for
it
a
language
with
more
exceptions
and
irregular
forms
will
be
harder
to
learn
by
pretty
much
any
measure
you
use
than
the
same
language
without
those
irregularities
so
yes
some
languages
are
harder
to
learn
regardless
of
your
frame
of
reference
edit
anyone
care
to
say
why
theyre
downvoting
its
a
fucking
thought
experiment
to
show
that
it
must
be
true
for
other
languages
language
does
not
have
some
magical
universal
law
of
complexity
which
forces
complex
languages
to
become
simpler
and
simpler
languages
to
become
more
complex
im
sorry
if
you
cannot
comprehend
two
languages
being
identical
other
than
one
difference
for
the
sake
of
a
thought
experiment
this
falls
under
the
umbrella
of

pathology

if
youre
interested
in

and
working
with
kids
isnt
your
thing
aphasia

occurs
in

this
is
a
very
broad

could
you
narrow
it
down

a

what

sparks
your
interest

which
of

i

it

and
never
used

again
then
again
i
mostly
do

use

you

you
need

you
can

in

seriously
anything
you

pretty
cool
can
be
turned

just
start

you
can
always
add

to

you
have

suggestions
maybe

into

its

rapidly
growing
field
and

people
are
taken
by
the
idea
of
big
data
and
what
it
can
tell
us
about
what
people
think
about
stuff
and
you
can
do
pretty
cool
stuff
because
there
are
all
kinds
of
tools
that
are
freely
available
eg
here
in
proper
german
please
just
say
hochdeutsch
instead
of
proper
german
we
do
have
pitch
accent
in
norwegian
i
suspect
people
just
know
more
about
swedish
generally
than
about
norwegian
one
example
of
framing
would
be
the
difference
between
1
the
book
is
between
the
computer
and
the
lamp
2
the
book
is
between
the
lamp
and
the
computer
the
content
is
identical
and
they
mean
the
same
thing
but
trajector
and
landmark
are
exchanged
because
you
think
one
is
more
salient
than
the
other
most
argument
structure
alternations
are
also
content
identical
but
have
some
little
intent
or
focus
differences
attached
to
them
this
is
sort
of
what
i
was
working
on
this
in
addition
to
ucrculvers
comment
turkish
is
spoken
in
turkey
and
aramaic
and
coptic
are
still
used
in
religious
contexts
by
christians
the
areas
in
which
arabic
is
spoken
as
a
majority
language
today
were
already
semitic
speaking
before
the
7th
century
the
main
exception
of
course
is
egypt
and
the
nonpunic
parts
of
north
africa
but
those
areas
still
used
afroasiatic
languages
there
was
a
wonk
featured
on
rbadlinguistics
who
asserted
that
polish
was
the
best
language
for
reasons
above
yeah
i
was
curious
about
that
claim
as
well
this
is
from
hagopians
1907
grammar
of
ottoman
turkish
ie
before
atatrks
reforms
it
reads
all
the
turkish
verbs
are
conjugated
in
the
same
way
these
being
no
irregular
verbs
except
the
substantive
defective
verb
to
be
but
there
are
certain
modifications
required
by
the
law
of
euphony
which
hold
good
in
the
inflections
of
verbs
as
in
those
of
other
parts
of
speech
im
curious
about
this
source
which
claims
atatrks
language
reforms
regularized
verbal
paradigms
i
quickly
scanned
my
copy
of
geoffrey
lewiss
2002
the
turkish
language
reform
and
didnt
immediately
come
across
anything
like
that
generally
its
just
easier
although
i
was
thinking
about
it
and
i
have
had
conversations
that
ive
had
to
use
5
or
more
locations
and
the
signing
does
get
confusing
there
have
been
many
writers
who
have
had
profound
influences
on
their
languages
vergil
and
cicero
shaped
latin
into
a
language
for
poetry
forensic
oratory
philosophy
etc
and
its
hard
to
overestimate
their
influence
over
language
in
the
middle
ages
as
well
figures
like
dante
and
shakespeare
were
similarly
influential
shakespeare
coined
or
popularized
many
words
and
has
been
a
model
for
english
as
well
now
we
mainly
use
him
as
an
example
in
historical
linguistics
books
but
in
the
early
days
of
english
grammar
when
scholars
were
writing
the
first
grammars
and
dictionaries
he
was
an
important
model
for
how
english
should
be
this
is
kind
of
a
funny
question
for
linguistics
since
the
study
of
linguistics
has
moved
away
from
thinking
about
individual
influence
similarly
to
history
moving
away
from
the
great
man
nevertheless
its
a
good
question
because
there
were
hugely
people
in
the
past
who
were
hugely
influential
this
strikes
me
more
as
a
question
whose
answer
straddles
lit
history
and
linguistics
one
notable
difference
is
that
greek
is
a
centum
branch
whereas
indoiranian
is
a
satem
branch
although
i
think
the
notion
of
centum
and
satem
comprising
distinct
clades
of
ie
has
fallen
into
disfavor
i
learned
that
we
got
them
from
persian
through
ottomans
and
they
do
sound
really
similar
to
the
persian
words
tanak
taenk
kola
kolu
ku
ku
obrva
abru
kuda
ko
na
zaen
but
like
i
said
maybe
my
professor
was
a
bit
biased
you
either
have
evidence
against
his
claim
of
no
embedding
in
piraha
or
you
accept
it
i
hope
you
miswrote
did
you
mean
to
write
you
either
have
evidence
against
his
claim
of
no
embedding
in
piraha
or
you
dont
which
isnt
quite
true
either
because
i
might
accept
something
as
evidence
and
you
might
not
talk
in
talk
someone
into
something
is
a
phrasal
verb
it
must
go
with
someone
into
something
and
it
doesnt
have
the
meaning
of
talk
so
basically
you
might
not
want
to
regard
talk
as
a
transitive
verb
in
that
case
id
accept
that
a
lot
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
importance
of
manila
in
the
philippines
its
the
social
economic
cultural
etc
center
of
the
philippines
tagalog
and
english
just
so
happen
to
be
spoken
there
so
this
prestige
spills
on
over
to
the
two
languages
in
order
to
be
succesful
in
the
philippines
a
knowledge
of
both
languages
are
pretty
much
required
though
you
can
probably
get
away
with
knowing
only
english
also
government
sponsorship
of
tagalog
plays
a
huge
role
the
government
chose
tagalog
back
in
the
30s
because
of
manilas
importance
among
other
reasons
for
la
fin
de
semaine
its
not
really
a
matter
of
conservatism
because
there
was
no
word
for
it
in
european
french
before
weekend
was
adopted
its
just
that
quebec
french
is
more
resistant
to
anglicisms
than
european
french
so
for
new
concepts
theyll
invent
a
new
word
rather
than
copy
the
english
one
so
clavarder
vs
chattertchatter
for
to
chat
courriel
vs
mail
for
email
but
thats
true
only
for
formal
speech
because
at
the
same
time
the
colloquial
language
includes
a
lot
of
english
words
or
calques
that
are
not
used
in
europe
uh
horse
shit
never
read
the
comments
im
interested
more
in
documentation
and
policy
and
syntax
so
not
really
haha
its
named
after
them
but
wasnt
actually
invented
by
them
i
dont
know
how
seriously
to
take
it
but
this
paper
in
science
suggests
a
common
germanobaltoslavoitaloceltic
ancestor
after
indoiranian
tocharian
and
anatolian
had
split
off
i
was
aware
of
them
but
i
am
considering
that
type
of
inflection
to
be
marked
it
is
less
common
than
affixation
i
really
dont
know
very
much
about
the
semitic
languages
or
the
ie
languages
that
inflect
with
vowels
i
am
aware
of
basically
how
arabic
works
though
i
have
many
arabic
speaking
students
and
i
often
elicit
words
and
phrases
from
students
who
are
hanging
out
between
classes
occasionally
in
class
if
i
can
think
of
an
excuse
in
nw
borneo
there
are
some
languages
that
use
ablaut
blust
1997
shows
that
it
historically
formed
from
prefixes
and
infixes
i
know
this
is
considered
the
exception
i
understand
that
it
usually
develops
from
vowel
grading
right
but
it
is
a
fairly
new
development
and
might
give
clues
as
to
howwhy
these
type
of
things
develop
the
3
of
the
4
protoforms
do
not
use
the
tip
of
the
tongue
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
evidence
or
counter
evidence
it
means
that
both
currently
and
historically
these
languages
still
didnt
use
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
maybe
that
is
the
motivation
for
the
change
something
thats
not
that
hard
to
explain
but
thats
entirely
not
available
in
spoken
languages
are
directive
verb
gestures
i
dont
know
the
american
sign
language
but
at
least
in
dutch
sign
language
you
have
those
where
you
basically
indicate
eg
subject
and
object
within
the
gesture
for
instance
drinking
is
nondirective
i
drink
beer
would
just
be
be
me
beer
to
drink
like
a
normal
sentence
is
in
dsl
but
for
the
directive
word
giving
he
gives
it
to
her
is
the
sign
for
to
give
and
you
move
your
hands
from
him
to
her
maybe
in
text
its
hard
to
explain
after
all
in
most
of
the
sources
african
francophones
are
not
taken
into
account
whereas
in
ivory
coast
gabon
snl
algeria
etc
many
speakers
are
native
speakers
and
the
number
of
francophones
is
rapidly
growing
so
youre
right
the
main
question
is
what
is
a
francophone
and
very
often
people
fight
about
this
questionthe
real
answer
is
that
you
can
only
give
a
range
and
not
a
precise
number
some
questions
sounds
really
strange
to
me
french
based
creol
and
fluent
without
litteracy
about
wikipedia
wellsome
time
ago
statistics
on
wikipediaen
were
just
a
joke
for
ex
you
could
read
that
20
millions
of
french
people
were
talking
occitan
so
that
the
real
french
speakers
were
only
about
40
millions
in
france
lol
i
think
this
information
was
from
ethnologue
hope
its
better
now
yep
its
a
voiceless
alveolar
lateral
affricate
yeah
i
say
towel
like
it
rhymes
w
the
name
al
i
dont
think
my
r
is
different
in
those
words
also
although
i
keep
cotcaught
distinct
i
have
a
mix
guessing
from
ga
influence
at
college
and
all
between
the
on
pronunciations
like
don
and
dawn
have
different
vowels
for
me
but
either
vowel
can
be
used
in
on
so
it
can
rhyme
with
either
word
though
i
think
i
prefer
donon
also
with
or
in
words
like
horrible
i
have
a
but
of
a
mix
horrible
is
always
harable
horror
haror
orange
arenge
but
florida
is
often
florda
but
also
flarda
sounds
right
too
but
horor
for
horror
sounds
wrong
to
me
if
youre
not
talking
about
ug
then
you
shouldnt
be
using
the
term
but
what
you
described
before
wasnt
merely
general
cognitive
abilities
ran
and
man
rhyme
sometimes
it
depends
on
the
inflection
of
the
sentence
sometimes
ran
has
the
same
vowel
sound
as
man
and
other
times
its
different
it
depends
on
the
placement
of
the
words
downtownclownfrown
all
rhyme
with
one
another
and
sound
more
similar
to
man
than
to
ran
you
have
never
met
my
60yo
dad
then
hes
caught
on
to
doing
facebook
messages
like
a
champ
oh
cool
this
paper
is
by
andras
kornai
he
wrote
an
awesome
book
which
is
responsible
for
whatever
understanding
of
linguistics
i
have
as
a
data
scientist
ill
definitely
be
taking
to
time
to
work
through
this
paper
its
the
first
time
ive
seen
his
actual
research
come
up
and
the
methodology
being
used
looks
interesting
a
strong
statement
of
purpose
good
recommendations
and
a
serious
drive
to
be
successful
in
this
field
even
though
i
was
pretty
late
to
the
game
thats
all
you
need
although
it
may
depend
on
the
school
itself
some
departments
take
a
lot
of
nonmajors
some
seem
to
exclusively
take
ling
majors
and
of
course
it
all
depends
on
your
particular
research
interests
and
how
they
compare
to
what
the
faculty
works
on
and
what
other
students
are
there
i
think
the
crucial
detail
here
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
word
data
datum
is
the
original
singular
but
with
the
advent
of
electronic
computation
data
increasingly
becomes
used
as
a
singular
mass
noun
such
that
depending
on
how
pedantic
you
feel
the
data
shows
a
clear
trend
is
more
grammatical
then
the
data
show
a
clear
trend
so
if
its
a
mass
noun
how
do
you
refer
to
individual
pieces
of
data
how
do
you
refer
to
individual
constituents
of
other
mass
nouns
water
droplets
pieces
of
furniture
i
am
unable
myself
to
account
for
the
variations
of
nounnoun
compounds
and
partitive
phrases
but
in
my
own
experience
both
data
points
and
points
of
data
are
acceptable
although
the
former
is
used
more
i
like
it
its
a
nice
way
to
freshen
up
the
rlinguistics
experience
yes
and
completely
separately
in
the
same
split
with
the
same
verbs
too
i
think
thats
pretty
fascinating
interesting
to
note
too
is
that
at
the
north
of
italy
and
the
south
of
germany
switzerland
the
present
perfect
is
the
only
past
tense
used
in
conversation
if
i
didnt
think
about
it
as
i
said
it
i
would
never
have
noticed
to
be
honest
i
too
thought
it
was
pretty
contrived
example
they
have
sugar
and
spice
fitting
into
their
hierarchy
when
it
was
definitely
just
because
of
a
rhyme
of
a
song
but
i
feel
like
they
were
onto
something
even
if
their
direction
was
a
little
off
dont
confirm
the
stereotype
about
lazy
undergrad
students
you
have
both
the
authors
name
and
their
mentors
names
a
quick
search
will
yield
their
email
addresses
and
possibly
facebook
profiles
you
could
have
the
papers
available
by
this
this
evening
edit
i
sent
the
email
address
in
a
message
and
i
pronounce
7
as
a
single
syllable
when
counting
fast
anyway
but
i
havent
got
the
book
in
front
of
me
he
reports
the
english
numbers
take
13
second
to
say
on
average
the
chinese
under
a
14
or
similarcant
remember
exact
values
but
you
get
the
gist
op
asked
about
both
working
and
long
term
memory
note
the
question
emphasis
mine
am
i
the
only
one
who
feels
that
this
would
pose
a
serious
burden
on
working
and
long
term
memory
what
is
and
isnt
computationally
possible
absolutely
has
to
do
with
working
memory
similarly
storage
is
really
only
relevant
for
discussing
long
term
memory
were
absolutely
addressing
ops
question
another
hint
for
2
if
you
dont
recognize
the
words
immediately
try
to
divide
them
up
into
syllables
you
might
then
recognize
part
of
the
word
which
will
help
you
find
the
solution
about
half
agree
with
me
if
you
could
see
the
vote
count
i
believe
the
aa
of
this
chart
is
supposed
to
be
a
while
ah
is
im
appalled
that
hes
done
this
to
the
deaf
community
but
at
the
same
time
i
see
the
humor
that
drove
steven
colbert
to
do
a
parody
thats
really
interesting
any
chance
you
could
record
a
few
example
sentences
and
post
them
to
a
site
like
soundcloudcom
so
we
can
hear
them
the
situation
of
sing
is
pretty
much
parallel
to
that
of
tell
as
in
the
direct
object
of
sing
is
related
to
its
verb
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
the
one
of
tell
i
sing
a
song
i
sing
a
song
to
you
i
sing
you
a
song
i
tell
a
story
i
tell
a
story
to
you
i
tell
you
a
story
one
of
the
commenters
is
saying
that
this
is
not
asl
but
see
nobody
says
gonna
instead
of
going
that
would
allow
gonna
to
which
as
far
as
i
know
is
not
allowed
anywhere
but
would
love
to
be
proven
wrong
one
of
the
major
differences
it
that
in
quebec
french
english
words
are
pronounced
in
their
english
form
as
opposed
to
parisien
french
where
they
will
frenchify
the
english
words
they
use
yeah
except
that
is
not
what
heteronormative
or
cisnormative
means
outside
of
your
idiolect
no
its
not
wildly
offensive
but
if
you
are
a
sociolinguist
you
should
know
what
the
widely
accepted
definitions
of
those
words
are
even
if
you
choose
to
use
those
words
differently
if
you
dont
feel
like
it
do
it
as
a
favor
to
all
us
noncishet
folks
out
here
poultry
refers
to
a
category
of
birds
that
are
used
for
food
this
category
includes
chicken
however
poultry
is
not
just
used
to
refer
to
a
type
meat
but
also
the
birds
themselves
you
can
talk
about
living
chickens
only
used
for
laying
eggs
as
poultry
and
you
can
also
talk
about
buying
some
poultry
at
the
grocery
store
although
that
sounds
weird
because
its
a
broad
term
that
would
be
like
saying
youre
going
to
the
store
to
get
some
domesticated
mammal
meat
im
not
offended
at
all
im
happy
being
right
about
how
language
works
while
you
fail
to
grasp
a
simple
concept
that
language
first
and
foremost
is
what
is
used
not
what
others
prescribe
it
to
be
what
do
you
mean
by
the
same
kind
of
understanding
there
is
definitely
no
obvious
difference
in
the
way
you
understand
another
language
as
long
as
you
are
reasonably
fluent
no
they
werent
etruscans
vocalic
phonology
for
example
was
i
u
e
the
consonants
were
n
p
p
t
t
k
k
ts
s
h
l
j
w
r
thats
much
much
smaller
especially
when
you
consider
the
diphthong
and
tripthong
arrangements
in
latin
and
greek
ah
i
missed
it
ok
thats
what
i
thought
you
meant
yeah
you
were
clear
the
first
time
what
new
yorkers
waiting
in
line
i
weep
soon
theyll
be
asking
for
carry
out
or
asking
for
food
for
here
i
think
that
we
conflate
our
concepts
and
our
words
hugely
when
theres
a
reasonably
good
mapping
between
them
hey
thats
cool
i
was
already
a
redditor
when
you
guys
had
the
pinker
one
cant
believe
i
missed
it
thanks
for
linking
these
up
for
me
same
thing
with
the
sandwich
question
a
hoagie
grinder
and
sub
are
all
different
things
and
an
italian
sandwich
is
a
specific
hoagie
grinder
or
sub
hoagie
is
cold
grider
is
hot
and
a
sub
is
a
different
kind
of
bread
and
can
be
hot
or
cold
thing
is
i
want
to
do
this
automatically
without
knowing
that
to
verb
is
a
constructions
beforehand
whatd
you
have
to
do
for
it
the
article
doesnt
really
answer
its
own
question
and
only
talks
about
danish
two
words
ive
seen
used
in
canadian
french
are
oportrait
and
autoportrait
both
also
recommended
in
termium
and
the
gdt
used
in
canada
on
top
of
the
direct
borrowing
selfie
itself
ive
seen
a
few
lectures
related
to
work
with
the
ethnologue
they
take
the
work
pretty
seriously
and
its
pretty
secular
as
far
as
the
academic
side
goes
its
super
hit
or
miss
when
it
comes
to
sil
folks
northern
ireland
actually
although
weve
spent
time
in
england
and
australia
yes
you
are
right
some
of
the
grammar
features
intonation
of
question
markers
are
facial
features
deafblind
cant
see
the
facial
markers
in
those
cases
grammatical
manual
markers
are
added
the
sign
space
is
smaller
i
frequently
interprete
tactically
comparatively
to
my
native
sign
my
tactile
must
change
speed
because
i
have
hands
on
my
hands
i
have
to
be
very
aware
of
facially
placed
signs
so
i
dont
poke
myself
with
their
hands
foundationally
asl
and
tactile
asl
are
the
same
just
curious
does
that
mean
romanian
ive
noticed
that
other
people
are
not
ashamed
to
say
where
are
they
from
but
we
romanians
use
such
terms
european
to
hide
the
country
origin
that
unless
you
come
from
a
more
obscure
country
lets
say
moldova
latvia
an
umlaut
changes
the
sound
of
the
vowel
like
in
german
the
diacritic
in
coperation
is
called
a
diaerisis
an
is
used
to
mark
a
hiatus
although
the
two
look
identical
they
developed
independently
of
one
another
in
china
it
was
always
over
the
top
saying
how
great
youre
doing
when
all
you
said
was
hi
in
taipei
people
mostly
dont
say
anything
and
just
let
you
have
the
conversation
outside
of
taipei
though
its
almost
always
about
how
biaozhun
youre
speaking
tagalog
has
a
verb
prefix
magkanda
that
means
to
occur
accidentally
or
involuntarily
as
a
result
of
something
and
involving
three
or
more
doers
i
have
only
seen
it
in
a
grammar
book
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
it
in
speech
nope
there
are
a
few
animal
communication
people
in
my
department
with
pure
linguistics
backgrounds
and
therere
a
few
in
psychology
who
work
in
communication
or
reasoning
in
bees
and
cephalopods
sure
im
not
suggesting
that
nobody
says
it
im
just
trying
to
put
some
firsthand
experience
in
there
although
its
contrary
yes
i
like
conlanging
as
an
artistic
pursuit
but
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
to
actually
analyze
them
linguistically
theyre
not
real
languages
dont
pretend
that
they
are
for
that
matter
what
about
you
have
got
to
you
gotta
ockhams
razor
isnt
that
the
simplest
theory
is
the
best
but
that
the
theory
that
makes
the
fewest
assumptions
is
likely
the
most
correct
im
by
no
means
an
expert
on
the
subject
but
i
would
guess
that
it
was
a
common
enough
word
that
the
traders
changed
it
in
their
mnsing
language
it
wasnt
a
big
change
they
just
switched
the
order
of
the
syllables
for
the
old
swedish
word
for
coffee
kaffi
you
know
how
you
can
sometimes
understand
a
conversation
even
if
you
only
understand
one
or
two
words
per
sentence
my
theory
is
that
they
needed
to
change
all
the
common
words
so
that
outsiders
couldnt
read
the
meaning
of
the
really
secret
words
from
the
context
youve
made
a
lot
of
contributions
but
what
i
think
is
really
cool
is
your
updates
on
your
fieldwork
its
a
more
detailedrealtime
view
than
a
lot
of
people
who
havent
done
field
work
will
ever
get
id
definitely
call
this
as
anglosaxon
runes
its
a
descendant
of
the
futhark
writing
systems
and
anglosaxon
runes
makes
sense
with
the
location
of
the
runes
tolkiens
dwarvish
was
based
on
the
futhark
runes
explaining
the
simikarities
understandable
my
understanding
was
that
the
ez
was
from
the
latin
genitive
suffix
is
of
the
third
declension
although
it
might
have
originated
as
a
calque
of
surnameformation
conventions
of
the
visigoths
point
one
1
thanks
we
never
use
emdashes
in
our
inhouse
style
guide
so
i
just
kind
of
forgot
about
them
point
2
yeah
end
of
a
long
day
for
anyone
else
curious
about
the
15
figure
in
the
title
i
think
he
got
it
from
trudgill
trudgill
1999
standard
english
what
it
isnt
standard
english
is
a
dialect
which
is
spoken
as
their
native
variety
at
least
in
britain
by
about
1215
of
the
population
and
this
small
percentage
does
not
just
constitute
a
random
crosssection
of
the
population
they
are
very
much
concentrated
at
the
top
or
as
some
would
prefer
the
top
of
the
social
scale
the
further
down
the
social
scale
one
goes
the
more
nonstandard
forms
one
finds
trudgill
2001
the
sociolinguistics
of
modern
rp
perhaps
therefore
it
will
be
as
well
to
discuss
where
this
statistic
came
from
the
guilty
party
was
myself
i
popularised
the
3
figure
in
trudgill
1974
incidentally
i
also
suggested
that
only
12
of
the
population
were
speakers
of
standard
english
implying
that
9
of
the
population
normally
speak
standard
english
with
a
regional
accent
as
mentioned
in
chapter
15
i
did
not
however
pick
this
figure
out
of
thin
air
it
was
on
the
contrary
rather
carefully
considered
and
was
arrived
at
in
the
following
way
my
sociolinguistic
urban
dialect
study
of
the
city
of
norwich
some
of
the
findings
of
which
were
presented
in
trudgill
1974
was
based
for
the
most
part
on
interviews
with
a
random
sample
of
50
people
taken
from
the
population
of
the
city
this
was
a
genuine
random
sample
in
which
the
entire
votingage
population
at
that
time
people
aged
21
and
over
had
an
equal
chance
of
selection
as
is
normal
with
such
samples
a
small
number
of
people
refused
to
help
and
one
person
had
died
these
were
replaced
in
the
normal
way
by
others
also
selected
randomly
i
also
rejected
from
my
sample
people
who
had
not
been
brought
up
in
norwich
and
its
vicinity
there
was
no
point
in
investigating
the
phonology
of
norwich
english
by
talking
to
lancastrians
the
number
of
people
rejected
in
this
way
was
also
very
small
it
would
certainly
have
been
much
larger
today
out
of
this
sample
of
50
people
only
one
was
an
rp
speaker
none
of
the
rejected
outoftowners
was
an
rpspeaker
either
in
other
words
the
evidence
from
my
random
sample
was
that
the
population
of
norwich
contained
only
2
of
rp
speakers
with
additional
evidence
what
youre
proposing
might
be
possiblei
know
nothing
about
american
linguistics
so
i
dont
know
where
one
might
begin
to
look
for
that
sort
of
thingbut
sometimes
all
we
have
are
tantalizing
hints
especially
from
small
corpora
polish
is
a
lot
like
english
in
that
it
has
taken
words
from
many
different
languages
the
core
is
slavic
but
there
is
a
strong
latin
influence
via
the
church
i
assume
there
is
significant
french
from
18th
and
19th
centuries
i
think
and
italian
influence
an
italian
queen
reputably
gave
poland
all
its
words
for
vegetables
theres
german
and
russian
from
periods
of
occupation
and
of
course
english
for
anything
modern
it
makes
it
a
fun
language
to
learn
out
of
curiosity
how
would
you
develop
a
latin
orthography
for
vietnamese
and
you
have
to
cut
rhodes
some
slack
he
couldnt
predict
350
years
of
language
change
thanks
i
left
those
words
as
an
exercise
for
the
op
direct
link
to
paper
take
asl
learning
how
signed
languages
leverage
simultaneity
eg
classifier
incorporation
and
space
eg
spatial
actor
referents
and
handle
directionality
eg
the
direction
of
gesture
in
asl
give
will
broaden
your
insights
into
language
it
will
really
help
you
think
about
morphology
in
particular
indeed
i
see
no
reason
why
amateurs
and
professionals
cant
coexist
in
the
same
sub
because
brevity
the
guy
500
leads
me
to
believe
that
country
folk
from
all
over
the
world
talk
in
the
exact
same
way
im
living
in
texas
and
if
he
just
spoke
english
instead
of
frisian
no
change
in
mannerisms
or
speaking
patterns
just
the
words
he
was
using
then
he
would
fit
in
perfectly
around
here
by
phonetically
identical
do
you
mean
having
the
same
inventory
of
sounds
i
assume
this
is
what
you
mean
rather
than
every
word
in
the
language
having
the
same
phonetic
form
there
are
probably
no
languages
that
are
phonetically
identical
but
there
are
languages
that
are
more
similar
than
others
sometimes
this
is
because
theyre
closely
related
to
each
other
sometimes
this
is
because
they
have
been
in
contact
for
a
long
time
and
sometimes
its
just
due
to
chance
to
give
you
an
example
due
to
contact
haitian
creole
and
french
have
very
similar
inventories
of
sounds
there
are
a
few
sounds
in
haitian
creole
not
in
french
eg
nasalized
high
vowels
and
vice
versa
eg
rounded
front
vowels
but
not
very
many
additionally
since
much
of
the
lexicon
of
haitian
creole
is
derived
from
french
it
is
often
possible
to
tell
what
a
haitian
word
means
if
you
know
french
however
theyre
not
mutually
intelligible
hence
the
need
for
interpreters
who
speak
haitian
and
not
just
french
any
two
languages
whether
they
have
the
same
inventory
of
sounds
or
not
are
going
to
be
mutually
unintellgible
unless
they
are
extremely
close
relatives
if
theyre
that
closely
related
theyre
likely
though
not
necessarily
going
to
be
considered
dialects
of
the
same
language
there
is
an
app
dictionaryformids
that
can
take
a
mdf
formatted
dictionary
and
convert
it
into
a
cellphone
app
either
java
or
android
several
major
languages
are
already
in
programs
repository
but
the
power
of
the
program
is
for
those
working
with
minority
languages
who
have
access
to
the
dictionaries
being
developed
here
lately
we
must
be
catching
every
one
i
remember
the
last
one
here
sometime
in
december
was
a
pacific
coast
language
cant
remember
which
presumably
dna
not
sure
anyone
speaks
pali
these
days
to
be
able
to
confirm
but
there
you
go
you
can
find
this
on
the
wikipedia
page
for
pali
by
the
way
which
is
where
i
got
it
might
check
there
in
the
future
for
this
sort
of
thing
i
like
your
response
but
i
want
to
question
you
about
a
generalization
about
the
set
of
grammatical
utterances
in
the
language
that
can
be
read
either
two
ways
as
a
generalisation
about
a
set
of
utterances
belonging
to
a
speech
community
or
a
generalisation
about
the
set
of
utterances
that
each
individual
of
a
given
speech
community
might
make
these
in
my
mind
are
very
different
and
can
vastly
shape
the
research
program
one
has
do
you
take
yourself
to
be
studying
a
general
concept
of
a
language
eg
english
as
a
whole
or
as
the
sounds
of
individual
speakers
that
one
might
demarcate
as
belonging
to
the
same
language
this
was
really
interesting
thanks
for
sharing
i
think
theyre
crucially
different
in
what
you
take
as
being
studied
then
the
utterances
of
a
speech
community
or
the
members
of
that
speech
community
in
the
former
youre
studying
a
set
of
utterances
thats
akin
to
a
public
language
while
in
the
latter
youre
studying
the
individuals
that
produce
and
recognise
utterances
in
light
of
being
a
member
of
a
given
speech
community
not
the
whole
story
but
itll
be
enough
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
it
seems
to
me
that
you
take
them
to
be
equivalent
but
i
dont
think
so
the
philosophers
notion
of
public
language
is
definitely
not
the
same
but
also
a
common
view
within
linguistics
of
language
as
a
sociocultural
tool
is
basically
akin
to
this
view
of
public
language
as
well
the
real
issue
that
flows
from
this
is
that
if
you
take
the
object
of
study
seriously
then
what
youre
studying
in
part
is
the
language
ability
that
one
has
in
order
to
become
part
of
this
speech
communitygenerate
the
proper
strings
given
previous
knowledge
i
think
these
issues
very
much
force
an
evaluation
of
the
position
in
regards
to
acquisition
of
the
language
and
what
system
or
ability
we
take
to
be
at
the
root
of
the
set
of
utterances
that
we
take
ourselves
to
be
studying
sorry
about
that
i
use
mostly
harmless
as
an
extension
on
chrome
to
see
where
things
have
been
posted

and
it
works
90

so
that

dont
repost

the

it

i

thats
what
i
really
like
i
hear
it
only
sparingly
in
connecticut
in
no
way
is
on
accident
taking
over
here
we
use
it
western
new
york
well
my
father
whos
in
his
60s
uses
it
all
the
time
people
my
age
mid
20s
mostly
try
not
to
and
then
feel
ashamed
when
the
occasional
yous
slips
in
bc
younger
person
me
and
all
of
my
friends
talk
like
that
we
learnt
about
today
i
didnt
realize
this
was
a
bc
thing
haha
if
humans
as
a
species
had
prehistorically
evolved
blind
then
it
would
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
species
would
have
evolved
other
capacities
to
compensate
without
a
lack
of
sight
humans
would
be
extremely
vulnerable
to
larger
predators
during
the
day
and
out
in
the
open
so
chances
are
humans
might
have
become
nocturnal
or
might
live
underground
or
in
cavernous
areas
or
conversely
if
humans
solely
lived
in
such
environments
then
sight
would
eventually
degrade
and
lead
to
partial
or
full
blindness
as
it
would
no
longer
be
useful
with
a
more
limited
living
space
and
food
supply
humans
would
probably
also
be
considerably
smaller
currently
some
blind
people
are
able
to
echolocate
so
it
wouldnt
be
far
off
to
assume
that
a
wholly
blind
human
species
would
rely
heavily
on
echolocation
especially
for
wayfinding
with
this
as
an
important
sense
and
with
a
smaller
body
frame
the
pitch
of
our
voices
and
calls
might
also
be
considerably
higher
than
they
are
so
what
happens
to
language
heres
the
debatable
part
if
food
supply
is
limited
and
since
humans
cannot
fly
humans
would
probably
be
more
like
moles
ie
they
would
probably
be
a
mostly
solitary
species
except
for
mating
and
maybe
for
raising
purposes
with
adult
males
being
especially
territorial
the
consequence
of
all
this
would
be
that
human
communication
would
be
extremely
limited
well
have
echolocation
for
wayfinding
calls
for
other
purposes
warning
scaring
etc
and
maybe
a
very
limited
language
for
other
information
identification
of
other
people
cooperating
with
a
mate
raising

etc
but
that
would
probably
be
the
extent
of
it
and
unless
ever
forced
out
of
that
habitat
our
mental
capacity
and
language
ability
would
likely
never
ever
evolve
or
expand

multiple

to
your
comments
that
its
acceptable
in
their
dialects
along
with
january
14th
youve
been
getting
the
evidence
youve
had
multiple
people
telling
you
the
original
data
was
insufficient
or
a
poor
representation
or
not
actually
reflecting
what
youre
purporting
it
to
reflect
but
instead
of
listening
to
any
one
of
them
youre
just
downvoting
the
people
you
disagree
with
show
me
any
indication
that
youre
willing
to
actually
learn
something
from
all
these
people
trying
to
explain
whats
going
on
otherwise
theres
nothing
more
to
say
there
are
also
grammatical
features
look
at
for
example
for
irish
english
do
you
like
kipling
i
dont
know
you
naughty
boy
ive
never
kipled
making
language
uniform
would
eliminate
the
problem
of
miscommunication
across
cultures
and
create
a
more
globalized
community
yes
it
would
for
a
while
all
englishspeakers
spoke
british
english
for
a
while
but
then
britain
decided
to
set
up
the
empire
now
there
are
pretty
much
as
many
englishes
as
there
are
members
of
the
commonwealth
exactly
imply
is
a
verb
explicit
is
an
adjective
i
read
all
of
these
with
the
voice
of
bobby
hill
impersonating
a
yiddish
comedian
but
seriously
this
is
really
interesting
ive
mentioned
before
that
i
want
to
research
jewish
sociolinguistics
and
jewish
english
and
i
would
definitely
devote
some
time
to
this
topic
this
symbol
ill
use
im
not
saying
it
would
solve
the
problem
but
it
could
help
the
way
humans
think
about
gender
and
other
such
concepts
is
greatly
influenced
by
language
just
look
at
cultures
where
all
nouns
are
gendered
it
means
something
in
the
culture
even
if
it
makes
no
real
sense
if
you
really
do
not
believe
language
has
a
powerful
influence
on
how
people
think
read
orwell
or
something
ya
sure
it
seems
to
be
a
growing
trend
i
dont
hear
people
above
50
using
it
i
wonder
why
role
and
reference
grammar
gets
so
little
attention
its
a
moderate
functionalist
approach
you
should
take
a
look
into
this
one
whats
the
current
understanding
of
the
sumerian
vowel
system
my
sumerian
grammar
suggests
there
are
five
or
even
eightvowel
reconstructions
but
it
doesnt
go
into
detail
on
which
ones
might
be
more
or
less
probable
any
thoughts
and
as
sort
of
a
corollary
if
you
had
to
give
a
totally
unscientific
guess
to
what
extent
do
you
think
sumerian
was
more
allophonic
than
the
writing
system
lets
on
is
there
much
potential
for
getting
a
better
understanding
of
sumerians
allophones
through
its
relationship
with
akkadian
or
are
we
doomed
mostly
to
speculate
questionwhat
do
you
mean
by
rhotic
compensation
that
isnt
something
ive
heard
of
before
g
is
very
rare
but
not
absent
in
dutch
there
are
probably
quite
some
words
that
were
imported
from
english
recently
though
a
morpheme
boundary
is
marked
by
you
could
still
write
that
between
none
of
the
other
consonant
clusters
are
necessarily
true
clusters
all
of
them
can
be
treated
as
single
consonants
an
affricate
and
prenasalized
consonants
im
not
really
sure
where
youre
getting
the
idea
that
a
prenasalized
stop
cannot
be
preceded
by
a
vowel
in
fact
ive
been
working
to
show
you
that
prenasalized
consonants
are
found
wordmedially
youll
note
for
instance
that
they
can
serve
as
the
onset
for
any
syllable
but
cannot
be
a
coda
this
is
also
true
of
nonprenasalized
consonants
you
have
lots
of
evidence
that
points
toward
nasal
consonant
including
f
acting
as
a
single
unit
and
basically
none
that
points
toward
them
acting
as
individual
units
yup
but
not
as
a
coauthor
footnote
credit
is
sufficient
they
can
probably
claim
some
license
over
them
too
heres
an
overview
of
some
problems
with
the
slate
article
hell
analogy
can
also
introduce
irregularity
like
dive
dove
the
japanese
syllabic
system
for
loanwords
katakana
is
utilized
when
they
try
to
bring
english
loanwords
into
their
syllabic
system
it
has
sounds
which
always
ends
in
a
vowel
and
is
typically
a
consonant
vowel
pairing
the
exception
is
the
n
or
m
sound
denoted
by
which
doe
not
end
in
a
vowel
so
a
word
like
heart
winds
up
becoming
haato
because
the
closest
sound
to
a
t
sound
is
a
to
sound
or
a
word
like
nuance
becomes
nuansu
for
the
same
reason
but
a
reasonably
simple
word
like
pen
can
be
perfectly
written
out
in
katakana
as
pen
other
than
the
difficulty
of
ending
words
in
a
consonant
sound
other
than
n
or
m
other
issues
include
the
difficulty
with
l
sounds
w
sounds
and
v
sounds
starting
with
the
l
sounds
they
often
approximate
with
an
rbased
syllabic
character
so
the
word
release
would
become
in
katakana
ririsu
another
example
is
the
name
lola
which
in
katakana
becomes
rora
now
for
the
wbased
sounds
they
approximate
using
modified
ubased
sounds
so
they
use
u
a
small
vowel
character
to
make
sounds
like
wa
wi
wo
we
wu
so
to
write
it
out
wi
ui
or
wu
we
ue
or
for
vbased
sounds
they
take
the
u
and
add
a
tenten
or
a
apostrophe
on
top
to
modify
the
sound
to
be
a
b
sound
which
is
their
approximation
for
v
sounds
for
example
va
ba
or
vi
vu
bu
or
ve
be
or
and
vo
bo
or
of
course
they
try
their
best
to
make
it
a
v
sound
but
it
doesnt
always
come
out
that
way
and
can
often
result
in
them
saying
the
approximated
b
sound
to
give
an
example
of
a
wordname
which
when
converted
to
japanese
katakana
sounds
odd
consider
west
virginia
converting
this
to
katakana
incorporates
all
the
ideas
i
said
above
it
becomes
or
if
spoken
uesuto
baajinia
in
short
they
dont
just
try
to
read
the
english
word
outright
without
any
conversion
they
try
to
put
in
katakana
sounds
that
gets
as
close
as
possible
to
the
english
sound
which
is
kinda
difficult
at
times
to
do
and
can
be
very
clunky
hence
why
english
words
used
in
jpop
sound
very
off
at
times
edit
made
a
small
correction
in
the
katakana
for
west
virgina
as
per
udevynci
and
an
odd
hiraganakatakana
that
my
input
method
editor
wrote
when
i
was
writing
the
sound
out
as
per
uetalasi
good
except
i
cant
think
of
a
single
word
in
german
that
uses
a
y
english
also
uses
y
in
many
positions
due
to
orthographical
conventions
from
when
spelling
began
to
be
standardized
by
that
point
the
yogh
had
been
lost
and
the
vowels
i
and
y
were
more
or
less
interchangeable

so
thats
who
i

is
there
a
reason
you
didnt

because
i
didnt

close

and
go
all
the
way
up
the
tree
the
french
revolutiion
over
the
precontact
history
of
america
really
the
french
revolution
directly
impacted
the
american
revolution
and
is
the
foundation
of
a
lot
of
democratic
thought
the
country
pays
to
educate
children
because
were
trying
to
educate
citizens
unfortunately
its
more
important
to
develop
citizens
who
understand
the
scope
of
democracy
rather
than
the
history
of
hundreds
of
independent
groups
who
lived
in
the
americas
regardless
of
their
own
political
systems
was
the
french

itself
also
borrowed

in

thank
you
this

please

this

there
thanks
oh
ok
i
hadnt
considered
that
possibility
now
i
have
no
idea
what
exactly
chomsky
does
mean
by
syntax
could
you
recommend
any
work
which
explains
this
that
is
simply
not
true
they
are
from
the
same
galloromance
branch
modern
irish
grammar
wise
the
one
ive
always
had
suggested
is
the
new
irish
grammar
by
the
christian
brothers
i
also
supplement
this
with
a
grammar
of
modern
irish
by
pl
murch
its
an
annotated
guide
the
the
first
one
for
a
really
linguistic
perpsective
on
modern
irish
however
i
think
modern
irish
grammatical
structure
and
dialectal
variation
and
learning
irish
by
mhel
siadhail
these
are
really
nice
linguistic
looks
that
are
also
good
textbooks
at
least
the
second
really
for
middle
irish
there
isnt
much
that
i
know
of
nor
could
the
professor
i
asked
really
tell
me
anything
unfortunately
nobody
has
written
a
good
book
about
the
changes
from
old
middle
modern
irish
for
old
irish
theres
a
load
of
stuff
but
the
only
one
ive
really
looked
into
depth
at
and
which
was
recommended
to
me
by
the
professor
whose
training
is
oldmiddle
irish
is
an
old
irish
grammar
and
reader
including
an
introduction
to
middle
irish
by
kim
mcscone
note
that
it
does
have
a
concluding
section
devoted
to
middle
irish
but
it
doesnt
really
detail
all
the
changes
from
oi
as
far
as
ive
seen
though
i
havent
gone
in
depth
with
it
those
are
all
more
grammars
if
you
want
some
other
stuff
just
tell
me
what
and
ill
see
what
i
can
dig
up
i
suppose
but
a
lot
of
africa
speaks
portuguese
as
well
and
if
you
studied
that
instead
of
french
you
could
speak
with
millions
of
africans
and
millions
of
south
americans
not
to
mention
youd
have
a
much
easier
time
with
spanish
so
youd
cover
a
couple
hundred
million
more
people
pretty
easily
as
well
heres
a
pdf
of
the
full
paper
the
author
says
his
identifications
are
obvious
whenever
someone
says
their
conclusions
are
obvious
i
immediately
consider
those
conclusions
suspect
particularly
with
something
as
thorny
as
the
voynich
manuscript
san
mounn
ftfy
what
a
weird
paper
their
entire
argument
against
the
possibility
of
the
brain
to
convert
discrete
symbols
into
continuous
time
dependant
symbols
seems
to
be
that
we
dont
know
any
mechanism
analogous
to
a
computers
clock
we
know
that
humans
can
keep
rhythm
were
not
perfect
but
still
pretty
good
by
necessity
we
must
have
some
timing
mechanism
in
us
we
dont
know
exactly
what
it
may
be
pretty
abstract
since
it
is
affected
by
mood
but
it
has
to
exist
i
really
doubt
it
has
anything
to
do
with
politics
and
simply
more
about
how
much
people
want
to
sound
correct
or
authentic
it
does
however
americanliberal
types
want
to
seem
more
worldly
tolerant
and
intellectual
and
hence
are
more
inclined
to
pronounce
names
authentically
and
often
end
up
hypercorrecting
in
the
process
more
rightwing
people
are
often
decidedly
antiintellectual
and
less
inclined
to
try
to
pronounce
names
correctly
you
should
watch
hoserie
rightwing
antiintellectual
canadian
redneck
hockey
announcers
in
canada
mess
up
french
and
foreign
names
so
much
so
that
it
often
seems
intentional
cf
us
newscasters
pronunciation
of
ahmadinejad
and
colberts
ongoing
mockery
of
the
phenomenon
i
was
trying
to
think
of
a
good
comparison
in
english
this
fits
pretty
well
i
am
a
native
english
american
speaker
and
i
have
had
trouble
understanding
anything
said
in
some
scottish
dialects
between
different
content
words
and
just
radically
different
pronunciations
yes
because
you
choosing
what
fields
matter
isnt
arrogant
if
you
dont
want
to
sound
like
a
child
i
suggest
next
time
asking
why
people
chose
their
field
adding
on
to
what
umostsuperlative
cites
from
berlin
kays
work
teal
could
be
considered
by
many
to
be
a
shade
of
blue
or
green
and
maroon
could
be
considered
by
many
to
be
a
shade
of
red
a
color
term
becomes
basic
when
the
majority
of
users
use
that
word
in
that
way
if
a
majority
of
people
consider
maroon
to
be
a
shade
of
red
it
is
not
basic
also
since
the
greenblue
color
space
is
relatively
large
compared
to
say
the
range
covered
by
orange
or
pink
theres
some
evidence
that
splitting
this
space
will
be
the
next
evolutionary
step
russian
has
already
done
this
with
light
blue
and
dark
blue
english
may
do
this
with
teal
or
turquoise
yeah
its
between
a
note
on
english
causatives
cruse
and
beware
fodor
thats
why
in
1994
i
founded
a
peerreviewed
academic
journal
that
is
free
and
online
people
from
plos
told
us
they
were
inspired
by
our
effort
and
there
are
lots
of
free
online
academic
publications
nowadays
though
ours
is
in
hibernation
atm
argggh
does
anyone
know
whats
wrong
with
the
formatting
of
my
second
link
well
we
have
very
good
recordings
of
contemporary
conversational
english
but
the
vast
majority
of
linguistic
theorizing
doesnt
take
it
into
account
some
do
study
connected
speech
but
unfortunately
its
usually
monadic
narrative
or
reading
very
few
recognize
dialogic
interaction
as
a
significant
factor
for
language
so
in
that
sense
it
wouldnt
make
a
difference
since
linguists
by
and
large
ignore
the
conversational
data
we
do
have
it
does
not
seem
so
surprising
to
me
that
there
would
be
some
pressure
to
use
ambiguity
in
a
communicatoryefficient
manner
but
that
does
not
explain
why
ambiguity
exists
in
the
first
place
when
it
could
have
been
quite
clear
massively
redundant
language
instead
that
seems
to
rest
on
the
central
point
why
ambiguity
in
the
first
place
i
dont
doubt
that
this
paper
shows
how
ambiguity
can
be
used
to
great
effect
in
communicatory
efficiency
but
i
wonder
why
such
a
feature
was
introduced
in
the
first
place
that
it
seems
cannot
be
explained
by
recourse
to
communication
ideas
when
there
exists
better
methods
for
ensuring
complete
and
rigorous
communication
i
dont
think
this
question
can
be
answer
and
it
can
only
be
speculated
upon
but
the
thing
is
that
if
language
did
evolve
from
proto
language
communication
systems
then
it
was
slow
unguided
evolution
this
means
that
there
was
no
end
point
in
sight
and
thus
no
way
to
aim
at
what
to
us
would
seem
an
optimal
solution
so
whatever
pressures
where
present
in
the
history
of
the
evolution
of
language
would
be
responsible
for
how
it
is
now
edit
further
why
dont
we
see
ambiguity
in
animal
communication
systems
i
can
imagine
that
ambiguity
could
be
used
as
a
local
maxima
for
communication
efficiency
but
it
seems
strange
to
how
one
would
evolve
from
known
animal
communication
systems
to
one
that
has
ambiguity
to
such
a
fundamental
degree
how
do
you
know
how
would
you
know
i
mean
with
bees
its
clear
but
thats
a
boring
example
now
take
more
interesting
examples
like
perry
dogs
or
dolphins
how
do
you
know
there
are
not
ambiguities
how
would
you
go
about
investigating
it
its
not
clear
to
me
theres
pretty
much
a
potential
infinity
of
consistent
hypotheses
with
a
given
data
set
and
give
language
input
data
there
isnt
enough
to
point
to
just
one
hypothesis
barring
assumptions
about
what
hypotheses
you
can
have
thats
not
to
say
that
you
cant
get
to
that
hypothesis
the
issue
is
how
you
choose
between
that
and
another
hypothesis
consistent
with
the
data
i
do
not
believe
children
can
make
infinite
many
hypothesis
regarding
data
i
think
the
learning
mechanisms
employed
are
a
natural
constraint
the
ub
way
although
incomplete
is
a
good
example
the
child
cant
make
multiple
hypothesis
he
can
only
generalize
from
phonetic
and
semantic
analysis
of
the
elements
that
hugely
limits
what
the
hypothesis
could
be
right
but
the
idea
is
that
even
that
algorithm
would
use
different
statistical
methods
to
analyse
the
data
not
necessarily
maybe
our
brains
can
only
use
one
statistical
method
like
in
connectionism
how
does
the
child
know
whether
a
cue
has
predictive
value
or
not
by
additive
evaluation
of
the
importance
of
the
cue
read
about
the
rescorla
wagner
model
each
new
observation
readjusts
the
value
of
the
cueobservation
if
the
cueobservation
values
are
two
low
they
can
be
dropped
or
something
like
that
take
the
classical
example
of
dogs
they
will
on
their
own
learn
to
pick
the
right
cues
for
say
receiving
food
or
going
for
a
walk
and
im
pretty
sure
they
dont
have
an
innate
mechanism
that
tells
them
to
listen
to
bells
or
look
at
shoes
they
can
learn
to
discriminate
cues
on
their
own
also
if
children
need
to
be
told
innately
which
cues
to
listen
to
for
which
phenomena
youre
in
huge
trouble
there
are
just
too
many
different
cues
that
would
need
to
be
specified
i
think
ive
seen
over
40
different
statistical
cues
used
in
different
models
and
not
every
cue
interacts
with
every
phenomenon
so
how
would
an
innate
system
help
there
would
it
pair
each
cue
with
each
possible
syntactic
morphological
and
phonological
structure
in
any
possible
language
that
makes
no
sense
an
unsupervised
discrimination
system
for
finding
cues
is
a
lot
more
likely
imho
specially
since
we
know
most
animals
are
capable
of
this
if
those
things
arent
connected
then
it
could
just
run
forever
no
thats
not
how
statistical
learning
models
applied
to
language
work
each
observation
reevaluates
the
conenctions
and
values
you
dont
first
gather
data
and
then
run
the
analysis
it
wont
run
forever
because
it
cant
run
forever
it
will
rerun
on
each
new
input
based
on
the
previously
established
values
again
think
of
the
dog
he
wont
get
stuck
running
an
analysis
for
ever
trying
to
determine
whether
the
position
of
each
hear
in
your
head
had
anything
to
do
with
you
taking
him
for
a
walk
in
the
exact
same
way
babies
wont
get
sucked
trying
to
determine
whether
humidity
and
atmospheric
pressure
have
anything
to
do
with
auxfronting
they
shows
that
this
cant
be
learned
i
cant
read
a
whole
dissertation
aint
nobody
got
time
for
that
on
what
basis
do
they
show
this
cant
be
learned
also
youre
back
at
the
old
argument
and
if
i
can
find
the
sentences
you
claim
are
not
present
or
a
statistical
pattern
in
the
data
that
would
predict
the
grammaticality
of
the
sentences
would
you
then
concede
the
pos
is
flawed
well
i
dont
really
know
what
you
mean
by
that
but
i
presume
you
accept
logical
and
mathematical
arguments
too
even
though
theyre
not
based
on
empirical
data
yes
but
not
only
that
many
arguments
for
additions
to
the
theory
are
not
based
on
empirical
data
but
on
say
economy
or
elegance
trying
to
have
a
minimal
system
also
a
lot
is
based
on
fakish
judgments
i
do
not
accept
that
as
data
but
thats
another
discussion
well
its
testable
but
thats
not
a
test
on
the
whole
argument
thats
a
test
on
a
particular
corollary
also
they
ignore
a
bunch
of
other
sources
of
data
speakers
could
use
to
determine
the
grammaticality
of
those
sentences
which
i
already
mentioned
like
ngrams
so
its
a
poorly
designed
experiment
tell
me
of
an
experiment
or
a
series
of
experiments
that
if
come
out
to
be
false
will
disprove
pos
in
the
form
youve
present
it
here
and
you
accept
all
my
premises
would
you
reject
such
an
argument
for
being
not
testable
if
you
designed
an
argument
such
that
it
is
not
testable
then
yes
i
will
rejected
even
if
all
your
premises
hold
basically
because
it
has
no
predictive
value
and
is
not
useful
now
my
question
to
you
would
be
what
would
convince
you
that
the
pos
argument
is
completely
false
the
upper
valley
of
new
hampshire
and
vermont
about
halfway
between
boston
and
montreal
its
a
strange
community
because
dartmouth
has
a
huge
impact
on
the
sorts
of
folk
who
move
in
from
elsewhere
its
your
normal
whitebread
northern
new
england
community
with
a
plethora
of
foreign
intellectuals
i
saw
that
one
online
and
have
used
it
a
few
times
since
though
im
american
guarani
is
alive
and
well
there
are
some
good
free
resources
first
i
recommend
renden
2008
chapter
7
which
will
directly
answer
your
question
so
my
question
is
is
there
any
research
being
done
into
the
languages
status
ie
is
it
still
being
used
by
a
majority
of
people
is
it
losing
ground
to
spanish
or
gaining
it
or
does
it
vary
across
domains
if
you
are
interested
in
knowing
more
about
guarani
i
recommend
the
gregores
1967
grammar
which
is
slightly
old
but
an
excellent
description
i
cannot
find
a
free
pdf
but
here
is
the
info
so
you
can
look
it
up
as
far
as
free
resources
go
there
is
also
cory
shains
2008
honor
thesis
to
summarize
a
point
from
renden
2008
guarani
is
being
influenced
by
spanish
first
of
all
they
now
have
a
definite
article
la
which
was
borrowed
from
spanish
in
addition
renden
suggests
that
guarani
is
using
periphrastic
constructions
over
highly
synthetic
morphological
constructions
here
is
an
example
of
just
that
from
renden
2008
here
is
a
periphrastic
construction
ajoheita
chejuru
1swashfut
mymouth
i
will
wash
my
mouth
here
is
an
incorporated
version
of
the
same
sentence
ajejuruheita
1sreflmouthwashfut
i
will
wash
my
mouth
guarani
is
a
neat
language
well
they
are
all
neat
but
i
like
guarani
a
little
extra
the
people
who
originally
spoke
it
migrated
from
the
area
that
is
modern
day
sao
paolo
brazil
it
is
an
interesting
because
it
is
widely
spoken
as
a
first
language
by
many
people
who
were
not
ethnically
descendants
of
the
guarani
people
i
cannot
think
of
another
instance
of
a
colonial
native
north
or
south
american
language
although
i
know
various
types
of
quechua
are
still
widely
spoken
in
south
america
but
i
dont
think
any
are
spoken
as
l1
by
people
of
european
decent
would
be
happy
to
be
mistaken
about
that
though
good
luck
in
your
investigation
there
is
a
lot
of
work
to
be
done
in
south
america
on
raskscience
we
have
started
a
series
of
faq
fridays
where
we
revisit
common
questions
that
people
frequently
ask
this
weeks
topic
is
linguistics
were
looking
at
these
types
of
questions
as
well
as
anything
else
relevant
that
comes
up
you
can
see
that
these
are
the
types
of
question
that
come
up
quite
often
amongst
nonexperts
and
they
often
contain
inherent
misconceptions
that
its
good
to
try
and
mend
so
this
is
an
invitation
to
come
and
help
out
wed
love
to
have
your
expertise
in
answering
any
questions
in
that
thread
or
to
provide
corrections
or
improvements
to
the
current
answers
in
the
faq
we
really
do
appreciate
any
contributions
theres
an
important
difference
between
describing
appropriate
speech
writ
large
and
describing
appropriate
speech
within
a
specific
formal
academic
setting
one
they
very
much
have
control
over
and
whose
atmosphere
theyre
responsible
for
i
havent
read
it
but
a
professor
i
respect
a
lot
has
recommended
her
book
sexing
the
body
is
also
really
cool
and
quite
short
done
how
about
just
the
face
that
chinese
sign
language
isnt
encoded
spoken
mandarin
and
since
signs
themselves
are
representative
of
lexical
items
tone
would
be
completely
irrelevant
honestly
before
op
posted
this
id
never
once
heard
anyone
suggest
that
they
did
such
a
thing
as
blinking
to
encode
tone
it
seems
like
such
an
odd
thing
to
begin
with
i
feel
like
the
claim
that
it
does
exist
is
what
would
need
backing
up
but
again
ive
never
head
of
such
a
claim
before
today
thank
you
ill
look
into
dmdx
in
the
future
this
sort
of
topic
is
better
suited
to
the
weekly
qa
thread
which
you
can
find
as
a
sticky
post
at
the
top
of
the
subreddit
the
supplementary
table
lists
salish
puget
sound
salish
clallam
distinctly
puget
sound
salish
includes
straits
salish
which
is
composed
of
individual
dialects
that
are
often
known
as
separate
languages
lummi
saanichsenchothen
samish
semiahmoo
sooke
songhees
it
probably
also
lumps
in
twana
which
can
sometimes
be
divided
into
skokomish
and
quilcene
and
also
lushootseed
which
is
comprised
of
skagit
snohomish
duwamish
puyallup
and
nisqually
dialects
halkomelem
doesnt
cross
the
border
and
the
olympic
salish
languages
chehalis
cowlitz
quinault
tillamook
are
all
extinct
salish
alone
is
probably
the
lumping
of
coeur
dalene
okanagan
columbiamoses
and
montana
salish
all
together
a
lot
of
these
folks
will
routinely
just
identify
their
language
as
salish
unless
their
interlocutor
actually
knows
about
the
different
languages
clallam
is
tough
the
last
native
speaker
passed
away
last
month
this
highlights
the
problem
with
using
census
data
that
its
not
very
useful
for
small
numbers
and
its
very
suspect
regarding
endangered
languages
census
numbers
are
selfreported
which
means
that
theyre
not
very
reliable
for
actually
enumerating
the
speaker
population
when
numbers
are
small
for
example
tlingit
is
reported
as
1141
speakers
in
the
us
census
but
the
communitys
own
census
of
native
speakers
gives
a
number
of
about
200
speakers
that
means
that
the
census
is
vastly
overreporting
the
number
of
speakers
of
the
language
this
is
in
part
due
to
language
learners
reporting
themselves
but
certainly
also
due
to
wishful
thinking
on
the
part
of
some
people
because
the
population
of
learners
isnt
that
big
so
you
really
shouldnt
take
census
numbers
very
seriously
when
looking
at
endangered
languages
with
the
death
of
the
long
form
census
in
canada
i
have
no
idea
how
reliable
the
data
will
be
on
first
nations
languages
in
the
future
we
dont
distinguish
between
the
s
sounds
in
zebra
salt
chile
jejune
only
one
of
these
words
has
an
s
sound
salt
zebra
has
a
z
sound
which
is
similar
voiced
vs
unvoiced
but
none
of
the
others
come
close
the
fourth
is
the
most
useful
as
it
actually
gives
dialectal
differences
as
pronunciation
varies
quite
widely
between
dialects
australian
here
i
used
to
call
it
the
number
sign
and
i
have
heard
it
called
the
pound
sign
these
days
i
call
it
a
hashtag
is
this
qu
french
because
i
swear
i
have
never
heard
it
called
carr
or
croisillon
by
the
way
the
official
translation
of
hashtag
as
motdise
was
suggested
typical
example
of
yet
another
word
that
will
be
printed
in
dictionaries
and
some
school
teachers
may
use
while
99999
of
the
population
will
just
take
the
word
from
english
i
think
you
have
some
causality
backwards
there
heres
a
little
more
info
even
more
info
probably
houstons
book
hmm
it
could
be
a
closure
further
forward
perhaps
along
the
hard
palate
then
wherever
it
is
it
needs
to
be
behind
the
frontmost
closure
or
else
there
wouldnt
be
any
highintensity
click
burst
the
click
sound
is
generated
by
air
rushing
into
the
vacuum
created
between
the
two
closures
as
the
tongue
body
drops
downward
before
release
in
normal
speech
the
closures
are
probably
made
simultaneously
due
to
likelihood
of
coarticulation
with
a
single
movement
of
the
entire
tongue
this
might
make
it
difficult
for
one
to
notice
the
tongue
configuration
as
having
as
two
distinct
regions
of
closure
what
is
the
place
of
the
sound
you
get
when
you
put
your
tongue
into
position
for
gc
but
instead
produce
a
nasal
sound
is
it
velar
palatal
uvular
etc
the
place
of
the
nasal
should
match
the
place
of
the
closure
that
is
further
backnd
it
shouldnt
be
dentalalveolar
n
sure
i
talked
to
my
sister
about
my
missing
ipod
and
she
was
like
i
havent
seen
it
since
mom
told
you
to
put
it
away
at
dinner
most
americans
think
of
this
when
they
hear
biscuit
thats
not
what
sic
means
sic
short
of
sic
erat
scriptum
thus
it
was
written
is
used
when
you
quote
or
cite
text
in
which
an
error
occurs
in
order
to
let
the
reader
know
that
the
mistake
was
in
the
original
and
not
your
doing
as
editor
author
etc
that
doesnt
answer
your
question
of
course
in
direct
speech
the
best
indicator
would
actually
be
air
quotes
either
that
or
saying
rather
pompously
sic
erat
dictum
no
but
i
have
managed
to
watch
it
only
took
just
over
an
hour
to
load
my
first
impression
is
that
they
got
laurens
name
wrong
shes
lauren
gawne
not
warne
here
is
her
blog
other
than
that
i
really
liked
the
story
i
like
how
they
interviewed
members
of
the
communities
themselves
rather
than
making
the
story
academiacentric
especially
since
the
whole
point
of
stevens
project
is
to
empower
speakers
to
take
agency
over
documenting
their
own
language
right
just
noting
that
constructions
similar
to
ja
hou
ii
are
perfectly
okay
in
serbian
people
using
the
da
lim
da
idem
its
a
weird
example
because
of
the
verb
are
however
most
likely
selfidentified
serbian
speakers
it
works
with
interrogatives
as
well
where
the
da
li
je
construction
is
a
serbian
thing
again
its
like
how
a
speaker
of
us
english
most
likely
isnt
going
to
ever
say
havent
you
a
cat
but
theres
no
difficultly
at
all
with
intelligibility
just
the
assumption
that
whoever
is
saying
that
probably
isnt
local
that
video
was
absolutely
wonderful
so
expressive
in
the
face
and
so
exuberantly
happy
xd
it
was
ridiculously
infectious
xd
biggest
grin
the
entire
way
through
d
i
just
started
learning
some
german
and
so
i
put
my
facebook
in
german
i
love
the
album
in
my
photos
titled
handy
uploads
mobile
uploads
lol
ai
can
be
a
frustrating
world
to
be
in
there
are
definitely
departments
that
work
on
this
though
many
do
but
gaelic
what
they
speak
in
scotland
gaidhlig
irish
is
irish
gaeilge
but
yeah
because
its
not
a
very
strongly
reinforced
distinction
people
who
are
not
familiar
with
irish
just
call
it
gaelic
from
memory
the
adventure
of
english
was
quite
good
bucholtz
gave
a
talk
today
about
this
amazing
program
that
takes
high
schoolers
and
gets
them
involved
with
linguistic
research
as
people
asking
questions
rather
than
as
participants
highlights
from
her
talk
include
characterizing
key
peeles
substitute
teacher
skit
as
a
fantastic
example
of
linguistic
aggression
and
this
amazing
student
response
to
gingrich
characterizing
english
as
the
language
of
prosperity
its
a
really
cool
program
that
i
learned
about
from
a
fantastic
talk
my
grandmother
would
sometimes
spell
her
name
theresa
as
teresa
when
we
asked
her
why
she
just
sort
of
giggled
and
brushed
it
off
and
we
never
got
a
real
answer
it
could
be
some
kind
of
throwback
to
her
parents
native
language
slovak
but
then
it
would
be
spelled
terzia
so
who
knows
im
very
adamant
about
people
spelling
my
name
right
so
it
just
baffles
me
i
read
somewhere
that
what
makes
ladino
hard
for
spanish
speakers
is
that
ladino
speakers
use
lots
of
hebrew
loanwords
dont
know
if
thats
true
to
an
extent
but
ladino
speakers
often
dont
think
of
them
as
part
of
the
ladino
lexicontheyre
still
hebrew
words
ladino
also
has
substantial
amounts
of
loans
from
other
languages
that
ladinospeakers
moved
to
after
the
spanish
expulsion
the
amount
varies
a
lot
though
also
ladino
lacks
a
consonant
merger
that
took
place
in
castillian
after
the
languages
diverged
intonation
though
in
speech
everyone
can
tell
the
difference
between
youre
at
home
right
now
and
youre
at
home
right
now
interestingly
it
is
james
evans
who
created
it
was
familiar
with
devanagari
and
modeled
the
shapes
of
the
initial
consonants
off
of
devanangari
glyphs
he
got
the
idea
of
using
different
orientations
for
vowels
and
the
shapes
of
the
final
consonant
glyphs
from
pitman
shorthand
i
think
the
writing
is
fine
and
the
meaning
was
perfectly
clear
to
me
when
i
read
it
earlier
this
week
its
like
the
phrase
accident
of
birth
your
grammarnazi
points
only
get
you
a
brownhat
edit
i
deleted
my
comments
since
i
was
getting
down
votes
without
any
discourse
i
can
find
another
venue
to
discuss
my
thoughts
without
problem
i
apologize
for
bringing
up
what
appears
to
be
a
sensitive
topic
sorry
folks
agreed
but
grammar
nazis
correct
spelling
mistakes
as
well
it
wouldve
been
a
pretty
funny
joke
cant
we
isnt
that
where
the
whole
formalist
stereotype
of
nonformalists
as
butterfly
collectors
comes
from
now
obviously
there
have
always
been
exceptions
like
the
famous
ken
hale
and
in
the
last
15
years
in
particular
this
has
started
to
change
but
i
still
think
its
true
that
most
language
description
is
done
by
functionalists
qed
thats
a
very
good
question
im
a
graduate
student
in
geography
with
an
strong
interest
in
linguistics
is
linguistic
geography
or
geographic
linguistics
a
sub
field
that
anyone
studies
are
there
are
papers
or
books
out
there
dealing
with
this
subject
im
aware
of
some
cool
project
like
wals
but
just
wondering
if
theres
any
literature
out
there
on
any
overlap
between
the
two
fields
i
use
to
do
this
on
purpose
but
in
spanish
class
and
sometimes
english
because
i
could
i
would
use
y
for
and
and
sometimes
other
words
that
are
faster
write
in
spanish
than
english
i
still
do
sometimes
because
why
not
edit
somebody
already
said
what
i
said
so
another
example
der
band
volume
of
a
book
die
band
musical
band
das
band
ribbon
if
you
think
regurgitating
logical
fallacies
will
make
your
statements
any
more
convincing
then
no
not
particularly
contrary
to
what
you
seem
to
think
your
view
on
gender
is
not
far
removed
from
your
participation
at
that
subreddit
in
fact
its
probably
a
direct
result
of
it
using
letters
developed
for
the
english
language
some
of
which
are
still
in
use
in
icelandic
for
example
now
restickied
to
say
that
the
larynx
isnt
being
used
at
all
is
not
exactly
correct
although
i
think
what
they
are
referring
to
is
the
vibration
of
the
vocal
folds
the
vocal
folds
can
be
held
close
together
causing
them
to
vibrate
and
create
voiced
sounds
or
can
be
spread
allowing
the
air
freeer
passage
creating
voiceless
sounds
however
the
larynx
also
controls
with
the
lungs
the
volume
of
speech
and
the
pitch
it
can
be
raised
or
lowered
to
a
degree
to
alter
the
pressure
in
the
vocal
tract
so
even
when
the
vocal
folds
arent
actually
vibrating
the
larynx
is
often
still
a
vital
part
of
the
speech
process
in
tonal
languages
in
particular
honestly
either
comparative
or
anthropological
linguistics
latin
has
a
relatively
small
vocabulary
and
so
the
language
is
highly
idiomatic
other
than
that
theres
just
certain
words
that
certain
authors
enjoy
and
so
thered
be
a
vocab
list
before
a
text
from
ovid
or
another
before
virgil
theres
obviously
the
words
in
common
but
the
core
vocabulary
to
be
able
to
read
relatively
well
with
a
dictionary
is
2000
or
so
words
mine
was
a
foreign
language
and
im
now
in
that
country
i
recommend
that
or
comp
sci
if
possible
i
really
recommend
taking
advantage
of
the
resources
you
have
at
university
and
adding
on
a
technicalpractical
element
to
your
ling
degree
comp
sci
is
a
great
option
in
a
growing
field
wsgs
is
interesting
but
i
think
youll
have
way
more
opportunities
when
you
graduate
with
lingcomp
sci
or
advanced
foreign
language
ability
yes
people
play
with
nongrammatical
things
all
the
time
to
convey
certain
things
in
french
for
example
making
fun
of
a
perceived
lack
of
intelligence
you
might
switch
to
a
more
regional
accent
like
in
the
us
so
someone
in
lille
might
say
something
patently
ridiculous
in
a
sarcastic
way
by
imitating
a
chti
accent
making
fun
of
an
american
accent
usually
involves
ignoring
gender
rules
stretching
vowels
and
pronouncing
all
of
the
written
consonants
that
normally
go
unpronounced
in
french
caveman
speech
works
similarily
omission
of
articles
and
copulas
strict
accusative
noun
usage
etc
spanish
and
arabic
both
in
my
experience
make
wide
use
of
different
accents
and
regionalisms
to
convey
specific
attitudes
for
example
in
a
lot
of
south
american
areas
using
an
argentine
particularly
from
buenos
aires
accent
conveys
a
sort
of
assholeishness
or
snobbery
chilean
accents
are
often
used
to
sound
silly
and
incomprehensible
a
bolivian
accent
particularly
from
a
place
like
cochabamba
sounds
very
backwoodsy
innocent
or
nave
an
arabic
speaker
in
saudi
arabia
might
imitate
an
urbanized
promiscuous
or
westernized
person
by
using
a
more
lebanese
accent
and
a
lebanese
speaker
might
use
a
more
bedouin
sounding
accent
to
imitate
olderpeople
conservatives
etc
all
arab
speakers
will
adopt
more
modern
standard
features
to
sound
authoritative
and
educated
though
arabic
is
interesting
in
that
you
would
expect
the
bedouin
nomadic
wanderers
to
be
considered
rather
backwoodsy
and
traditional
the
accent
that
in
most
languages
gets
picked
to
represent
lack
of
intelligence
but
in
arabic
there
is
instead
a
very
high
regard
for
bedouin
arabic
speakers
and
their
speech
is
regarded
as
purer
more
refined
and
poetic
despite
their
rejection
of
modern
lifestyles
here
is
a
link
to
a
short
paper
about
12
pages
without
references
called
the
future
of
kenyan
languages
adopting
the
principles
of
environmental
conservation
academiaedu
warning
i
think
it
is
appropriate
level
for
freshman
they
dont
need
to
understand
anything
about
linguistics
to
understand
the
authors
kibiwott
kurgatt
point
just
to
give
you
an
idea
what
it
is
about
i
will
quote
the
last
line
of
the
abstract
borrowing
from
the
principles
of
conservation
suggestions
are
madethat
can
be
taken
on
board
in
order
to
stem
the
threat
to
linguistic
diversity
in
the
kenya
i
thought
it
was
a
neat
paper
hope
it
helps
i
like
our
orthography
and
i
would
hate
for
it
to
be
gotten
rid
of
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
language
is
there
an
adjective
analogue
to
verbing
yeah
but
i
dunno
if
the
term
is
recognized
in
linguistics
merriamwebster
is
just
an
ordinary
dictionary
huh
having
spent
most
of
my
life
in
central
pa
ive
never
considered
dropping
to
be
to
be
out
of
the
ordinary
can
you
think
of
any
other
examples
where
the
past
and
present
tenses
of
a
verb
became
acceptably
interchangeable
if
he
rejects
psychology
as
pseudoscience
i
dont
think
theres
much
you
can
do
by
frequency
effect
i
mean
the
psycholinguisticphonetic
phenomenon
that
wordsphrases
that
are
more
commonly
used
tend
to
be
both
recognized
faster
and
articulatorily
reduced
more
often
for
instance
i
dont
know
is
such
a
common
phrase
that
its
often
reduced
to
dunno
or
iunno
but
its
still
easily
recognizable
as
such
how
would
you
pronounce
the
following
words
plutonium
lieutenant
nutella
newtonian
im
wondering
if
this
is
a
lexical
or
phonological
difference
ah
there
we
go
my
brain
was
failing
me
thanks
on
the
dolphin
point
they
also
understand
syntax
link
to
video
and
a
chimp
in
one
experiment
was
able
to
learn
how
to
communicate
with
ifelse
clause
structure
i
use
antconc
its
ok
free
and
does
the
job
check
out
the
faq
we
have
a
whole
page
on
careers
you
may
also
get
some
other
answers
here
though
so
ill
leave
it
up
yup
interesting
i
thought
you
could
use
ve
when
the
have
was
an
auxillary
i
havent
been
and
not
when
its
possession
ive
a
big
car
sounds
odd
or
are
we
kinda
saying
the
same
thing
wellth
wealth
it
isnt
incredibly
strange
but
coming
from
and
english
and
spanish
background
i
cant
help
but
feel
weird
about
it
whenever
i
think
about
it
korean
has
certain
pronouns
i
you
mine
which
when
spoken
are
almost
never
used
unless
a
sentence
is
assumed
to
need
clarification
to
tell
someone
i
love
you
you
simply
say
love
i
could
write
it
isubject
marker
youobject
marker
loveformality
marker
but
when
speaking
i
would
almost
never
say
a
sentence
that
way
albanian
has
a
verb
mode
that
indicates
surprise
its
mainly
but
by
no
means
exclusively
used
in
the
perfect
tense
and
with
the
verbs
have
and
be
ti
je
ktu
you
are
here
ti
qenke
ktu
are
you
here
ka
ikur
hes
left
paska
ikur
has
he
left
can
someone
please
explain
this
for
a
non
linguist
i
understand
the
language
is
english
but
can
you
give
some
examples
of
this
and
how
a
language
that
does
allow
negated
verbs
would
say
it
thanks
part
of
the
misunderstanding
is
that
youre
using
the
wrong
terminology
and
as
a
result
are
making
what
sound
like
nonsensical
claims
about
french
french
does
not
have
pronouns
attached
to
end
of
the
verbs
it
has
verb
conjugations
like
many
other
indoeuropean
languages
that
reflect
number
and
person
these
are
just
suffixes
not
pronouns
they
have
to
agree
with
the
pronouns
but
dont
carry
the
same
information
eg
pronouns
dont
have
tense
and
verbs
usually
dont
have
gender
and
lets
all
take
too
big
steps
backwards
yay
why
because
thats
how
i
control
my
people
dont
most
people
in
senegal
speak
french
though
none
of
these
languages
are
spoken
by
even
half
the
country
why
is
it
that
in
the
english
language
we
pronounce
leopard
as
lehpurrd
instead
of
leeohparrd
it
would
be
especially
interesting
to
uncover
anything
which
parallels
what
is
reconstructed
for
pie
cvh
or
hvc
ch
or
hc
as
in
some
instances
of
zerograde
ablaut
i
know
some
people
reconstruct
the
pie
laryngeals
as
having
a
syllabic
allophone
i
think
fortson
does
that
but
thatts
not
the
only
way
to
explain
the
outcome
of
chc
as
cvc
one
possibility
is
that
the
laryngeals
where
always
consonantal
and
an
epenthetic
vowel
was
added
to
pronounced
the
cluster
then
in
some
order
i
wouldnt
be
competent
to
decide
the
vowel
was
coloured
in
greek
raised
in
sanskrit
before
the
nonhigh
merger
reanalysed
as
underlying
and
the
laryngeal
dropped
leaving
cvc
the
dirty
little
secret
here
is
that
your
english
professor
is
using
hisher
own
definition
of
proper
in
general
prescriptivist
norms
around
whats
proper
are
just
a
ball
of
collected
pseudoscientific
rules
and
personal
preferences
some
more
common
than
others
theres
neither
internal
consistency
within
these
rules
nor
consistency
across
prescriptivists
as
to
what
they
are
linguists
describe
language
as
it
is
used
broadly
not
language
as
some
population
used
to
use
it
and
thinks
it
should
be
constrained
to
for
instance
once
upon
a
time
beg
the
question
was
a
specialized
phrase
used
only
by
philosophers
and
logicians
to
talk
about
argument
structure
nowadays
at
least
in
american
english
beg
the
question
is
used
by
the
general
populace
when
it
is
used
to
mean
raise
the
question
and
its
earlier
meaning
is
usually
called
circular
reasoning
or
a
circular
argument
now
one
could
and
some
frustrated
philosophers
and
logicians
do
say
that
these
people
are
laymen
using
technical
terms
incorrectly
but
that
would
be
to
fundamentally
misunderstand
language
change
or
at
least
to
misunderstand
the
motivations
of
the
general
population
theyre
not
trying
to
use
the
technical
term
they
may
not
even
have
ever
heard
it
and
to
needlessly
attribute
a
value
judgment
to
language
change
to
call
it
incorrect
is
to
call
this
change
bad
in
some
very
real
sense
so
what
does
that
mean
for
this
question
if
in
fact
uchubbydane
is
correct
in
saying
that
most
people
think
subjective
means
x
then
theres
absolutely
something
to
the
claim
that
x
is
one
of
the
meanings
if
not
the
primary
meaning
of
the
term
if
its
in
particular
the
statistical
claim
that
youre
disputing
then
thats
more
reasonable
but
you
havent
made
that
clear
god
forbid
linguistics
students
actually
studying
languages
ah
awesome
i
managed
to
figure
out
before
i
saw
your
message
but
the
other
two
werent
familiar
enough
on
an
unrelated
question
do
you
study
ancient
forms
of
chinese
on
a
professional
basis
im
curious
at
what
point
did
a
writing
system
emerge
sophisticated
enough
to
encode
literature
is
oracle
bone
writing
sufficient
for
this
or
was
there
some
earlier
form
that
shows
how
this
emerged
cheers
great
question
i
wish
i
knew
for
one
i
think
well
continuing
developing
our
quantitative
methods
as
we
have
over
the
past
couple
decades
but
well
also
start
mining
big
data
with
automated
scripts
and
algorithms
for
these
data
at
the
same
time
i
hope
that
well
have
a
bigass
movement
to
take
our
message
to
the
public
everyone
is
fascinated
by
linguistic
differences
and
we
need
to
be
there
for
public
education
on
a
formal
and
informal
level
documentaries
for
tv
and
education
museum
exhibits
and
formal
education
programs
for
kids
in
public
schools
need
to
be
implemented
its
interesting
important
and
socially
significant
shoot
we
even
have
a
new
campus
initiative
in
which
everybody
who
studies
teaches
or
staffs
at
nc
state
is
informed
about
language
diversity
language
diversity
needs
to
be
in
the
diversity
canon
but
the
impressionistic
labels
of
ialect
and
language
imprecise
as
they
may
be
can
usually
be
supported
by
data
rather
than
politics
no
they
can
not
there
is
no
measurement
of
how
similar
two
languages
have
to
be
to
be
considered
dialects
or
how
different
two
dialects
have
to
be
to
be
considered
different
languages
elsewhere
in
this
thread
you
claim
that
there
was
a
consensus
i
think
youre
making
that
up
because
non
of
the
people
who
actually
work
on
this
sort
of
stuff
that
i
have
talk
to
agree
with
that
definition
you
gave
about
mutual
intelligibility
there
is
no
way
to
draw
the
line
why
do
we
say
there
are
four
nadahup
languages
but
only
one
spanish
about
90
of
the
vocabulary
is
shared
among
the
nadahup
languages
and
similar
figures
apply
to
spanish
dialects
or
why
are
german
dialects
called
dialects
even
though
they
are
almost
unintelligible
for
non
native
speakers
unless
you
make
use
of
the
case
system
as
is
done
in
some
dialects
and
formal
speech
then
you
must
know
you
grammar
wow
thanks
ah
okay
i
had
in
fact
misunderstood
you
im
interested
on
the
topic
so
ill
do
a
bit
of
research
and
come
back
if
i
find
anything
interesting
please
refrain
from
anecdotal
evidence
and
speculation
as
per
the
subreddit
rules
speculation
on
this
is
honestly
a
really
bad
thing
i
feel
we
will
never
be
able
to
turn
it
into
science
this
is
a
great
question
for
this
weeks
qa
thread
which
you
can
find
as
a
sticky
post
at
the
top
of
the
subreddit
please
repost
this
as
a
question
there
thanks
this

been
removed
so
you
neednt
delete
it
yourself
no
need
to

to

either
theres
a
few

you
can
find
via
the
gutenberg
project
that
more
or
less
teach
you
anglosaxon
as
far
as
i
know
if
you
come
to
such
an
eventuality
alternatively
you
could
send
a
letter
to
your
local

but
they
might
not
even
answer
you
because
theyre
busy
people
true
only

over

you
overexaggerate

perhaps
but
certainly
not
years
one
can
learn
a
foreign
language
to
fluency
by
immersion
alone
in
a
year
or
two
but
motivation
is
key
of
course
turkic
languages
only
came
there
from
the
11th
c
15th
c
only
indoeuropean
languages
were
spoken
in
turkey
then
edit
x
appears
in
blech
i
think
depends
it
can
also
be
in
bach
hanukkah
challah
and
a
myriad
of
lessbroadly
used
yiddish
or
hebrew
loans
first
question
how
would
one
get
into
endangered
language
research
as
a
career
research
subject
in
linguistics
second
question
is
if
i
come
out
of
college
with
just
a
ling
degree
could
i
supplement
my
employability
by
learning
a
few
programming
languages
or
should
i
get
a
certification
in
something
thanks
while
your
point
about
him
not
talking
to
linguists
isnt
accurate
i
think
that
the
celebrities
that
he
spoke
to
do
have
good
input
on
the
topic
people
like
george
takei
and
tim
gunn
have
voices
that
are
iconic
in
many
respects
nonlinguist
here
it
would
be
awesome
if
the
folks
making
the
infographics
could
party
with
folks
in
the
know
there
could
be
a
subreddit
of
experts
that
people
could
post
links
to
when
they
see
facepalm
infographics
or
yeah
a
factchecking
subreddit
not
sure
if
there
would
be
any
progress
but
i
bet
the
arguments
would
be
on
a
grand
scale
being
of
philadelphian
descent
the
representation
of
the
philadelphia
accent
in
the
kroll
show
demonstration
didnt
sound
like
an
accent
to
me
at
all
haha
theres
no
future
tense
past
drank
present
drink
future
will
drink
instead
of
a
different
or
modified
word
english
just
puts
the
word
will
in
front
of
the
present
tense
to
create
a
future
tense
ok
then
take
the
morpheme
ed
whose
phonetic
realization
is
highly
variable
what
are
the
things
that
make
this
is
tense
and
constructions
with
will
not
its
an
auxiliary
just
like
has
and
had
but
yet
you
consider
these
valid
tense
markers
you
would
never
find
a
sample
of
the
usage
of
auxiliary
has
or
auxiliary
had
that
didnt
have
the
same
syntactic
behavior
as
auxiliary
will
so
what
is
your
basis
for
making
a
distinction
the
word
will
effectively
acts
as
a
modifier
for
the
future
tense
but
its
noteworthy
that
its
unnecessary
and
is
a
wholly
separate
word
from
the
verb
it
modifies
do
you
not
realize
that
any
morpheme
is
considered
a
separate
morpheme
from
the
other
morphemes
that
they
appear
with
this
applies
just
as
much
to
ed
as
it
does
to
will
ll
has
had
etc
under
morphemic
analysis
everything
is
broken
down
into
their
constituent
parts
based
on
semantic
criteria
and
assessed
for
syntactic
and
phonetic
behavior
this
is
morphology
things
are
only
analyzed
as
either
a
bound
or
a
unbound
morpheme
he
said
hes
a
native
english
speaker
i
would
find
it
a
bit
awkward
for
him
to
be
confusing
it
for
something
like
this
but
i
suppose
its
not
outside
of
the
realm
of
possibility
especially
when
i
already
threw
x
in
which
is
just
as
uncommon
the
method
of
calculating
the

of

given

is

if
youre
interested
look
up

is
the
bayesian
mcmc
package
that
most
everyone
uses
for
computational
phylogeny
both
in
linguistics
and
in
biology
generally
a
lot
of
people
are
moving
towards
beast
from
what
ive
been
seeing
recently
that
just
creates
a
whole
new
set
of
problems
where
would
you
even
put
the
spaces
should
the
particles
be
treated
like
affixes
or
like
separate
words
are
the
verb
and
adjective
endings
part
of
the
word
or
separate
like
english
auxiliaries
this
is
absolutely
a
thing
i
should
have
considered
i
had
to
pick
a
timeframe
and
i
went
with
the
early
years
but
theres
arguments
for
several
time
frames
to
be
picked
otherwise
love
your

this
is
pretty
complex
for
a

love

in
the

one
of
the
great
things
about
the

age
is
that
you
realise
you
are
not
alone
in
any
having
incredibly
diverse
interests
are
you
positive
tk
would
undergo
metathesis
i
know
ringe
from

to

2006
thinks
it
would
but
i
am
not
terribly
convinced
could
you
point
me
to
some
academic
work
on
the
matter
i
would
have
to
look
up
some
sources
but
this
is
what
i
remember
from
my
old
philology
courses
the
relationship
between
sanskrit
and
latin
though
does
seem
to
support
what
im
trying
to
say
see
link
in
my
original
comment
if
etymonline
is
right
i
would
like
to
know
how
work
was
called
before
the
use
of
the
physical
object
of
the
tripalium
since
working
and
fatiguing
labor
certainly
existed
before
this
one
object
theres
a
few
ways
to
answer
this
question
im
going
to
start
with
how
i
got
into
linguistics
and
im
going
to
end
with
what
i
tell
undergrads
who
are
trying
to
communicate
the
value
of
linguistics
in
the
job
market
why
linguistics
i
quit
a
lucrative
it
career
to
become
a
cognitive
scientist
because
cognitive
scientists
are
the
best
people
to
choose
which
science
fiction
futures
become
real
were
the
best
at
understanding
how
people
interact
with
information
and
what
the
interface
between
people
and
technology
should
look
like
my
university
doesnt
have
a
cognitive
science
department
weve
got
a
bunch
of
the
traditional
disciplines
that
are
open
to
crossdomain
collaboration
but
wont
drive
this
on
their
own
this
presented
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
me
i
could
pick
up
expertise
in
a
few
domains
and
make
interesting
connections
between
them
myself
i
ended
up
in
computer
science
linguistics
with
an
advisor
in
cognitive
psychology
i
think
that
the
applicability
of
computer
science
and
cognitive
psychology
is
obvious
to
most
but
most
people
are
confused
about
that
linguistics
part
language
is
one
of
the
behaviors
that
set
us
apart
from
the
rest
of
life
on
this
planet
the
way
we
use
language
the
way
that
language
ability
develops
and
the
way
that
languages
are
learned
and
change
gives
us
tremendous
insight
into
what
makes
us
human
star
trek
gets
so
much
future
tech
right
they
talk
to
their
technology
and
it
responds
reasonably
people
already
talk
to
their
technology
i
know
i
mutter
and
swear
at
it
quite
a
bit
but
i
also
wheedle
cajolingly
etc
language
use
is
instinctive
and
if
we
want
to
tap
into
that
intuition
we
need
to
understand
it
why
hire
a
linguist
linguistics
as
a
discipline
is
about
picking
symbolic
structured
patterns
out
of
messy
data
we
understand
different
levels
of
representation
and
how
to
infer
and
appreciate
the
existence
of
regularity
in
nonobvious
ways
these
are
incredibly
portable
skillsets
how
is
labor
meaning
work
related
to
labor
meaning
giving
birth
but
it
can
be
illegitimate
if
the
person
is
making
an
argument
based
on
a
narrow
sense
not
in
common
usage
right
for
instance
in
the
examples
i
gave
hard
work
is
not
typically
considered
to
be
part
of
the
meaning
of
promotion
and
potion
drinking
is
not
typically
considered
to
be
part
of
the
definition
of
invincible
ive
seen
people
do
this
often
in
the
area
of
exegesis
and
thought
there
might
be
a
name
for
it
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
that
you
could
look
at
the
cognate
in
hebrew
cherem
and
its
associated
meanings
or
you
could
look
at
the
different
sets
of
laws
of
the
hebrew
communities
vietnamese
speaker
here
vietnamese
doesnt
have
a
subjunctive
mood
but
it
can
create
the
concept
of
subjunctivity
through

the
question
arises
of
how
much
of

is
a
human
cognitive
specialization
for
language
and
how
much
is
a
consequence
of
more
general
capacities
jackendoff
language
consciousness
culture
p
31
it
would
be
wonderful
if
we
could
further
divide
universal
grammar
into
aspects
specialized
for
language
and
aspects
used
in
common
with
other
cognitive
capacities
jackendoff
semantics
and
cognition
p

necessity
being
the
mother
of
invention
language
could
have
been
invented
by
resourceful
people
a
number
of
times
long
ago
universal
grammar
would
simply
reflect
the
universal
exigencies
of
human
experience
and
the
universal
limitations
on
human
information
processing
pinker
the
language
instinct
pp3132
it
is
this
line
of
reasoning
that
led
the
linguist
noam
chomsky
to
propose
thatchildren
must
be
equipped
with
an
innate
universal
grammar
a
set
of
plans
for
the
grammatical
machinery
that
powers
all
human
languages
the
logic
of
induction
mandates
that
children
make
some
assumptions
about
how
language
works
in
order
for
them
to
succeed
at
learning
a
language
at
all
the
only
real
controversy
is
what
these
assumptions
consist
of
a
blueprint
for
a
specific
kind
of
rule
system
a
set
of
abstract
principles
or
a
mechanism
forfinding
simple
patterns
which
might
also
be
used
in
learning
things
other
than
language
pinker
the
stuff
of
thought
p
30
im
well
aware
that
your
use
of
the
term
is
entrenched
in
functionalist
circles
but
the
blogger
in
question
was
talking
about
generativists
when
he
used
the
term
surely
at
a
bare
minimum
such
a
context
calls
for
a
brief
clarification
of
which
sense
of
the
term
he
is
using
thank
you
for
the
link
honestly
i
didnt
know
where
to
ask
this
question
do
you
know
of
a
better
subreddit
to
ask
this
question
its
the
anschluss
there
are
also
a

of
vietnamese
people

such
as
houston
austin

the

area
thanks
for
the
offer
im
pm
you
if
she
wants
one
of
the
books
to
look
at
the
author
of
that
map
which
i
didnt
know
about
says
that
he
combined
all
the
chinese
languages
into
chinese
one
problem
is
that
since
i
combined
chinese
languages
out
of
necessity
i
probably
shouldve
combined
some
other
languages
which
would
seem
to
account
pretty
nicely
for
the
discrepancy
that
works
only
in
very
simple
cases
for
example
japanese
kanji
characters
are
essentially
a
subset
of
china
hanzi
characters
but
ive
been
told
by
chinese
readers
that
they
can
only
read
very
short
phrases
of
kanji
a
full
sentence
of
japanese
kanji
is
unintelligible
to
them
despite
the
fact
that
the
individual
characters
have
the
same
meaning
note
that
im
talking
about
pure
kanji
here
i
know
most
modern
japanese
text
is
not
pure
kanji
but
thats
not
what
im
reading
to
if
you
were
to
take
a
french
newspaper
and
perform
a
wordbyword
translation
into
italian
would
the
result
be
correct
italian
this
video
was

pretty
recently
this
is

i
would
have
thought
that

iccs
are
at
least
as
common
in
german
as
they
are
in
english
so
at
least
within
the
realm
of
indoeuropean
languages
including
germanic
romance
and
slavic
languages
the
phenomenon
does
have
some
footing
however
its
status
within
these
lan
guages
may
be
different
in
fact
in
hohenhaus
2005
i
suggest
that
in
german
at
least
one
icc
seems
on
the
brink
of
becoming
an
established
lexeme
namely
filmfilm
it
is
certainly
institutionalized
in
its
original
role
as
a
category
label
consciouslychosenbythegermantelevisionchannelsatlnamelytodenote
their
slot
for
broadcasting
feature
films
as
opposed
to
say
documentaries
ie
the
reduplication
does
convey
the
characteristic
iccmeaning
of
proper
prototypical
x
it
can
be
argued
that
filmfilm
was
thus
somewhat
artificially
institutionalized
with
all
the
authority
that
an
institution
like
a
tv
channel
may
have
nonetheless
it
is
now
at
least
for
a
sizeable
proportion
of
germans
at
least
the
ordinary
television
viewers
itemfamiliar
and
will
as
such
be
stored
in
their
mental
lexicons
while
other
normal
iccs
still
remain
only
typefamiliar
ie
nfs
producible
and
interpretable
by
speakerlisteners
with
ease
but
without
entering
the
permanent
wordstock34
the
itemfamiliarity
of
filmfilm
is
also
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
it
is
often
alluded
to
mockingly
which
presupposes
common
knowledge
of
the
target
of
the
mocking35
it
may
be
speculated
that
even
though
filmfilm
was
made
institutionalized
artificially
its
status
still
hasnt
normalized
in
other
words
it
is
still
recog
nized
as
belonging
to
a
type
which
is
confined
to
spoken
spontaneous
conversa
tion
this
would
also
partly
explain
why
it
is
so
frequently
used
or
alluded
to
in
a
humorousmocking
way
suggesting
that
satls
or
anybodys
attempt
at
using
an
icc
outside
its
natural
domain
is
considered
somewhat
inappropriate
and
is
not
taken
altogether
seriously
35
a
recent
demonstration
of
that
sort
of
multiple
mocking
was
the
introduction
by
the
wellknown
german
comedian

recent

blue
in
romance
languages
italian
and
french
have
blu
and
bleu
from
germanic
spanish
has
azul
from
arabic
and
romanian
has
albustru
from
a
latin
word
referring
to
a
type
of
clay
did
latin
just
not
make
a
distinction
for
the
colour
blue
and
did
french
and
italian
borrow
the
word
from
germanic
languages
independently
or
before
they
split
definitely
better
than
english
but
there
are
exceptions
femme
oignon
plus
sud
words
ending
in
ent
i
suppose
the
programs
for
esslli
and
nasslli
also
might
help
you
narrow
things
down
at
nasslli
they
divide
everything
into
semantics
grammar
probability
games
philosophical
logic
and
language
computation
at
esslli
week

they
divide

into
three
groups

having
that
said
you
just
finished
your
junior
year
ive
changed
my
mind
loads
of
times
after
that
no
need
to
focus
on
a
really
specific
topic
just
yet
but
its
always
good
to
know
whats
out
there
and
who
is
doing
what
which
is
also
a
good
reason
to
subscribe
to
the
linguist
list
btw
so
the
context
for
5
to
be
ok
would
be
what
john
doesnt
feel
hungover
but
mary
the
cute
lady
from
last
night
said
that
he
looked
like
shit
so
he
decided
to
take
a
peek
in
the
mirror
for
5
even
if
i
could
find
a
satisfactory
context
i
would
have
a
very
hard
time
getting
the
required
coindexation
the
first
table
comes
across
to
me
as
a
reminder
of
how
important
this
vocubulary
must
have
been
as
people
met
and
transacted
with
speakers
of
a
neighbouring
language
not
only
the
individual
words
but
the
rhythm
with
which
they
are
read
in
order
you
only
have
to
picture
a
stallholder
trying
to
work
out
if
someone
was
trying
to
buy
six
apples
or
seven
and
counting
them
out
loud
from
one
to
be
sure
that
isnt
how
science
works
sure
it
is
all
science
is
humandriven
and
motivated
by
human
concerns
and
ideals
what
matters
is
if
the
evidence
supports
the
motivations
i
would
cite
arthur
eddingtons
gravitational
lensing
experiment
or
pasteurs
early
research
to
disprove
abiogenesis
as
prime
examples
where
pursuit
of
noble
goals
and
ideals
while
using
bad
science
ultimately
advanced
human
knowledge
but
semitic
and
egyptian
numbers
above
four
are
very
similar
and
they
only
differ
in
ways
that
are
already
attested
in
other
cases
sjt
sfxt
the
only
real
differences
are
f
b
and
x
both
of
which
appear
elsewhere
so
the
idea
that
their
common
ancestor
only
had
the
first
few
numbers
doesnt
hold
water
a
language
in
which
there
were
no
nouns
nope
there
is
no
such
thing
every
language
distinguishes
nouns
from
other
stuff
some
languages
are
funkier
than
others
but
all
do
so
you
might
like
reading
through
this
wikipedia
article
you
might
be
interested
in
a
recent
book
on
the
topic
called
holy
shit
i
be
happy
uses
africanamerican
englishs
habitual
be
something
which
standard
english
lacks
i
thought
that
i
be
happy
could
be
used
in
standard
english
well
at
least
in
standard
uk
english
it
is
called
subjunctive
example
i
insist
that
i
be
feeling
happy
its
fascinating
right
people
hear
him
and
assume
that
he
is
dumb
or
ignorant
but
if
you
listen
to
what
he
actually
said
he
is
fairly
concise
and
is
making
a
reasonable
argument
in
his
defense
aave
has
a
rich
history
and
developed
in
much
the
same
way
jamaican
standard
english
did
colonialism
slavery
imperialism
etc
someone
did
an
honest
translation
this
doesnt
answer
your
question
but
i
think
this
could
be
something
of
fools
errand
and
also
implies
that
we
could
agree
on
a
standard
spelling
or
even
more
unlikely
a
standard
pronunciation
from
which
to
derive
phonetic
spellings
english
in
north
america
is
changing
as
we
type
a
standard
spelling
system
might
just
fall
out
of
sync
with
the
spoken
language
in
a
generation
or
two
wow
thats
interesting
just
a
question
what
exaclty
is
the
difference
between
nj
and
you
make
an
excellent
point
about
no
single
pronoun
being
suitable
for
everyone
thanks
for
lending
some
perspective
id
hit
it
but
it
was
not
released
yet
hate
teasers
just
tell
me
about
this
game
after
the
release
please
swiss
finding
free
online
courses
is
a
good
suggestion
but
since
you
were
also
enrolled
in
an
intro
class
you
presumably
have
access
to
the
materials
and
syllabus
from
the
class
and
youve
already
started
working
through
those
even
if
you
didnt
finish
or
dont
feel
like
youve
understood
very
well
instead
of
starting
over
with
a
new
course
why
not
continue
like
its
an
independent
study
if
you
run
into
problems
there
are
forums
like
this
one
where
people
would
be
happy
to
help
you
out
the
intro
classes
that
ive
seen
have
lectures
readings
but
all
of
the
important
material
in
the
lectures
was
covered
in
the
readings
if
you
think
the
material
was
too
challenging
to
follow
on
your
own
then
provide
us
with
a
few
more
details
about
your
materials
and
the
topics
you
could
use
extra
help
with
the
easiest
intro
textbook
to
follow
is
probably
language
files
but
this
might
be
unsatisfying
for
someone
who
wants
something
more
detailed
or
theoretically
oriented
of
course
the
bonus
of
an
independent
study
is
that
you
can
go
as
slow
as
you
need
as
far
as
we
know
at
least
according
to
what
ive
read
we
have
an
unlimited
storage
capacity
there
are
no
reports
of
people
using
up
their
brain
storage
capacity
but
that
is
a
different
issue
you
can
only
learn
as
many
languages
as
time
would
allow
you
to
you
also
have
to
spend
time
practicing
and
using
those
languages
so
yeah
its
more
a
practical
constraint
than
anything
else
the
thing
is
though
that
as
they
are
used
language
and
dialect
are
inherently
political
terms
politics
isnt
incidental
to
the
distinction
to
a
great
extent
its
the
entire
point
of
it
youre
of
course
welcome
to
impart
those
terms
with
whatever
new
meaning
you
like
if
its
useful
but
you
have
to
recognise
that
to
a
large
extent
its
a
fundamentally
arbitrary
endeavour
of
course
you
can
talk
about
certain
languages
or
dialects
being
more
independent
from
each
other
than
others
in
this
respect
i
think
its
pretty
much
as
you
suggest
synchronically
looking
at
their
current
state
by
comparing
intelligibility
and
diachronically
through
examining
their
history
by
comparing
their
retention
and
innovation
of
grammatical
and
perhaps
phonological
features
but
since
for
example
innovations
arent
all
equally
important
its
very
difficult
to
quantise
that
kind
of
thing
which
in
turn
makes
it
difficult
to
set
an
actual
threshold
between
dialect
and
language
if
you
want
to
be
more
objective
and
unpolitical
i
dont
think
its
possible
to
completely
shut
out
the
politics
my
view
is
that
it
might
be
more
useful
to
ditch
the
languagedialect
binary
and
just
compare
linguistic
independence
as
a
continuum
you
also
have
to
distinguish
scots
from
scottish
english
i
think
you
should
explain
how
edit
for
those
downvoting
there
isnt
any
clear
difference
between
the
two
i
sent
you
a
book
thatll
help
you
most
of
my
problems
are
actually
institutional
i
get
a
lot
of
pushback
from
ethical
review
for
various
reasons
they
dont
understand
what
linguistic
research
is
like
they
insist
on
onerous
consent
forms
limit
the
amount
i
can
work
with
individual
people
per
year
and
other
bullshit
that
might
apply
to
some
other
fields
but
is
totally
inappropriate
to
my
work
i
feel
your
pain
brother
all
this
sounds
incredibly
familiar
to
me
as
an
indian
in
my
20s
that
accent
strikes
me
as
highly
unusual
from
the
conversation
in
that
video
id
assume
that
the
boarding
schools
which
used
to
teach
that
educated
accent
have
stopped
teaching
it
possibly
decades
ago
but
this
old
tibetan
do
you
know
any
new
language
the
languages
that
are
spoken
today
arent
any
different
than
the
languages
that
were
spoken
five
thousand
years
ago
languages
havent
become
more
sophisticated
or
modern
its
misguided
to
think
that
your
language
needs
to
be
more
like
new
languages
than
old
ones
youre
being
a
stereotypical
murrican
by
assuming
that
you
can
think
only
in
your
first
language
fair
enough
but
it
baffles
me
that
being
called
murrican
is
apparently
serious
business
round
these
parts
just
to
clarify
and
i
think
most
americans
would
agree
their
accents
generally
sound
typical
of
american
southern
but
there
are
notably
unusual
vowel
sounds
peppered
in
that
are
reminiscent
of
a
british
accent
and
personally
i
hear
what
sounds
to
me
like
a
very
subtle
hint
of
an
irish
lilt
more
than
rp
though
i
realize
the
origins
of
this
accent
are
by
no
means
related
to
either
rp
or
irish
pronunciation
in
the
first
place
those
last
two
are
interesting
it
seems
like
theyre
the
sorts
of
things
that
the
community
would
be
able
to
do
on
its
own
i
had
a
question
abot
one
of
the
things
you
said
in
the
article
words
in
nuxalk
are
more
flexible
and
ambiguous
not
fixed
like
in
english
its
more
interesting
because
the
context
matters
more
than
the
particular
word
what
do
you
mean
by
the
words
being
more
flexible
could
you
give
an
example
as
a
borges
fan
i
think
this
is
a
neat
idea
but
i
suspect
that
you
will
receive
a
better
response
over
in
rconlangs
a
sub
devoted
specifically
to
this
kind
of
thing
ah
yeah
i
guess
i
over
simplified
stuff
and
didnt
really
talk
about
go
on
etc
but
that
is
correct
anyway
japanese
characters
have
at
least
two
ways
to
pronounce
them
usually
and
most
have
like
3well
some
have
a
lot
more
also
now
that
you
mention
it
i
think
youre
right
about
the
korean
intermediaries
but
more
often
than
not
korea
was
basically
a
part
of
china
or
at
least
heavily
under
its
influence
i
noticed
the
other
day
that
i
often
omit
pronouns
in
sentences
typed
in
text
message
once
the
subject
is
mutually
understood
by
both
parties
i
then
started
to
look
through
other
past
messages
and
noticed
that
many
other
people
do
this
to
me
does
anyone
else
notice
this
is
there
a
name
for
it
and
is
there
a
good
source
for
these
kinds
of
examples
of
ways
in
which
texting
influences
our
syntax
oh
sorry
i
completely
missed
that
so
does
that
mean
i
have
to
delete
this
thread
linguists
often
say
that
language
extinction
causes
loss
of
knowledge
does
this
overlap
with
sapirwhorf
since
its
the
idea
that
language
influences
thought
how
could
anybody
not
know
the
word
bottlebrush
the
word
itself
contains
the
definition
a
large
portion
of
the
items
on
the
male
list
pertained
to
weapons
and
warfare
in
some
way
to
add
to
what
malignantmouse
said
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
chart
of
the
tongue
thats
not
a
common
descriptor
it
reflects
height
and
backness
of
the
tongue
but
also
lip
rounding
its
really
a
chart
of
the
vowel
space
most
commonly
its
just
called
a
vowel
chart
aspiration
is
the
delay
until
vocal
onset
it
is
as
a
notsoexact
definition
the
time
between
the
production
of
the
consonant
and
the
production
of
the
next
sound
the
vocal
cords
just
remain
open
afterwards
a
voiceless
glottal
fricative
however
is
a
dislocated
fricative
or
a
voiceless
vowel
depending
on
how
one
looks
at
it
it
is
friction
caused
by
air
movement
over
the
vocal
tracts
are
the
examples
you
gave
technically
different
yes
is
it
a
great
difference
no
anatomically
they
are
produced
just
differently
to
an
english
speaker
they
are
going
to
be
essentially
the
same
if
you
are
pronouncing
ph
as
ph
you
are
only
approximating
what
is
actual
happening
to
the
best
of
your
ears
ability
if
you
are
a
native
english
speaker
ph
is
the
sound
in
pin
and
p
is
the
sound
in
spin
or
bin
i
learnt
about
claymores
from
fps
games
i
thought
it
was
an
alternate
brisith
who
even
knows
of
toup
at
first
i
felt
the
exact
same
way
i
fought
hard
not
to
learn
it
and
i
regret
that
now
but
then
again
i
heard
people
say
the
same
thing
to
me
at
your
age
when
stressed
the
rhotic
vowel
corresponds
to
british
which
isnt
present
in
american
english
so
thats
one
clue
my
careful
enunciation
comment
was
in
response
to
this
i
wasnt
expecting
the
r
to
suddenly
appear
but
perhaps
there
would
be
a
instead
of
or
whatever
that
doesnt
explain
why
welsh
is
currently
in
much
better
shape
than
irish
the
fact
is
that
british
government
policies
attempted
and
nearly
succeeded
at
killing
the
irish
language
they
is
already
in
use
and
works
fine
they
is
really
only
in
use
in
the
case
of
an
unknown
gender
or
when
bound
by
a
quantifier
phrase
its
not
commonly
a
genderneutral
pronoun
in
the
strictest
sense
my
father
brought
their
lunch
remains
unacceptable
for
most
people
this
means
that
using
they
as
an
allpurpose
genderneutral
pronoun
is
also
a
novel
thing
it
is
therefore
not
intrinsically
preferable
to
xe
of
course
it
would
be
a
valid
question
to
ask
the
school
why
they
decided
on
a
neologism
over
an
extension
of
theys
genderless
usage
my
bet
is
they
wanted
to
avoid
the
backlash
from
the
antisingularthey
crowd
xhe
doesnt
even
look
like
an
english
word
thats
aesthetics
yay
feel
free

any
questions

the
test
displays
the
seconds
it
took
you
to
respond
its
like
having
a
column
heading
but
nothing
in
the
table
i
was
really
annoyed
because
a
nonword
i
got
was
suffrate
cmon
seriously
we
all
know
what
it
means
even
if
it
isnt
a
word
this
was
awesome
there
were
some
words
which
i
wasnt
sure
if
the
researchers
were
counting
as
words
or
notlike
denseness
i
thought
that
it
was
density
and
that
denseness
is
incorrect
thats
why
i
put
it
as
a
non
word
even
though
ive
clearly
seen
this
word
being
used
though
i
personally
do
not
use
it
or
consider
it
a
word
unless
denseness
is
different
from
density
merriam
webster
tells
me
it
means
someone
whos
not
intelligent
this
makes
sense
because
it
my
dialect
american
english
we
dont
use
the
word
dense
so
much
so
it
isnt
suprising
that
i
was
unable
to
recognize
the
morphological
process
it
goes
through
i
think
its
an
estimate
they
chose
60k
words
at
random
your
proportion
right
is
assumed
to
hold
for
the
whole
dictionary
something
like
300k
words
ie
the
whole
english
language
between
you
uvanessasays
and
uf2u
i
am
beginning
to
feel
like
my
70
is
pretty
bad
curious
since
im
no
dictionary
scholarare
there
other
examples
of
for
lack
of
a
better
term
the
social
categorization
of
words
in
dictionaries
im
referring
to
the
acknowledgement
of
certain
words
as
slurs
viking
refers
to
a
profession
like
samurai
its
linked
to
an
ethnicity
but
it
basically
means
scandinavian
pirateseafaring
raider
if
a
viking
finds
new
work
they
are
no
longer
a
viking
there
are
no
living
vikings
there
are
however
living
people
denoted
by
the
term
redskins
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
final
s
is
pronounced
even
though
it
shouldnt
be
is
that
right
interesting
on
a
somewhat
related
note
i
recently
read
on
language
change
the
invisible
hand
in
language
by
rudi
keller
in
that
he
claims
that
the
reason
we
have
so
many
negative
terms
for
woman
isnt
evidence
of
misogyny
but
actually
just
the
opposite
men
try
to
be
respectful
as
possible
to
women
so
instead
of
reserving
terms
like
lady
for
nobility
they
apply
it
to
all
women
which
depreciates
the
term
until
it
becomes
negative
eg
hey
ladymove
that
thing
as
much
as
bad
means
good
and
buddy
means
not
your
buddy
i
suppose
its
all
in
the
emphasis
i
know
these
towns
well
old
mines
is
just
30
minutes
from
where
i
grew
up
when
i
was
a
kid
in
the
70s
and
80s
we
used
to
drive
through
there
on
the
way
to
our
favorite
swimming
holes
and
to
hit
the
driveinflea
market
and
an
ancient
general
store
it
was
like
a
place
totally
lost
in
time
and
felt
quite
remote
and
isolated
you
could
still
hear
lots
of
locals
speaking
french
back
then
my
parents
were
fascinated
by
it
so
they
made
all
sorts
of
excuses
to
stop
there
now
the
roads
have
improved
dramatically
and
it
feels
much
closer
to
st
louis
though
if
you
keep
going
down
that
road
to
the
south
its
another
story
part
of
the
confusion
is
that
have
is
two
parts
of
speech
here
the
first
one
in
each
pair
is
an
auxiliary
and
the
second
is
the
main
verb
compare
i
have
gonei
had
gone
my
text
for
me
intro
class
was
an
introduction
to
langue
by
fromkin
i
highly
recommend
to
anyone
with
no
background
in
the
subject
that
wants
to
learn
more
it
goes
over
the
major
areas
of
linguistics
and
explains
them
very
simply
if
you
want
id
be
happy
to
mail
it
to
you
the
next
time
i
get
paid
as
long
as
you
promise
to
return
it
some
day
im
not
sure
if
theres
a
connection
but
this
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
number
system
in
classical
roman
mathematics
with
the
number
system
we
use
today
which
the
arabs
brought
to
us
from
india
we
have
a
number
line
with
a
dividing
point
at
zero
and
our
numbers
are
strictly
positional
9
8
7654321
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
so
you
know
that
689
is
6
hundreds
plus
8
tens
plus
9
ones
and
you
know
that
689
is
6
hundreds
plus
8
tens
plus
9
ones
less
than
zero
but
the
romans
did
not
express
any
concept
of
negativity
with
numbers
in
their
mathematics
a
debt
owed
was
not
a
minus
on
the
debtors
account
but
rather
a
plus
on
the
creditors
account
think
of
double
book
keeping
you
dont
just
keep
track
of
one
number
as
you
add
or
subtract
to
it
but
instead
every
time
you
take
from
one
column
you
add
to
the
other
so
jim
has
5
apples
josh
the
scary
school
bully
demands
7
from
him
how
many
apples
will
jim
have
we
could
say
5
7
2
jim
has
minus
two
apples
but
classical
latin
speakers
would
not
express
this
concept
of
negative
quantitiesnumbers
that
we
have
they
would
either
simply
revert
to
none
or
alter
the
context
jim
has
no
apples
or
jim
is
no
longer
relevant
to
this
discussion
about
apples
as
he
is
not
a
possessor
of
apples
or
jim
will
get
2
apples
in
the
future
to
give
to
josh
that
is
to
say
once
youve
reached
zero
you
stop
taking
away
numbers
or
objects
and
you
instead
switch
your
view
point
to
the
addition
side
of
the
equation
or
you
find
another
way
around
such
as
talking
about
future
circumstances
instead
of
current
ones
etc
the
covered
language
looks
like
italian
to
me
other
than
st
florent
its
sort
of
difficult
for
me
to
say
exactly
since
this
isnt
my
area
i
honestly
know
sanskrit
much
better
than
the
modern
descendants
but
theres
always
trouble
with
indoaryan
dialects
and
languages
i
know
the
government
classes
mawari
as
a
dialect
of
hindi
now
despite
it
having
differentiated
itself
from
hindis
ancestor
a
while
back
and
having
its
own
poetic
corpus
when
you
take
into
account
things
like
the
spread
of
media
youll
find
that
hindi
has
a
lot
of
exposure
in
the
north
so
that
will
skew
your
data
bear
in
mind
also
punjabi
is
a
pretty
huge
continuum
of
dialects
from
indian
punjab
into
pakistan
too
script
usage
and
vocabulary
actually
varies
quite
a
bit
the
more
you
travel
id
say
youve
got
a
few
main
areas
to
consider
in
terms
of
phonology
punjabi
uses
a
tonal
accent
rather
than
stress
as
in
hindi
punjabi
is
morphologically
more
complex
than
hindi
with
more
vestigal
cases
and
then
a
large
variety
of
postpositions
which
are
different
than
one
finds
in
hindi
lexically
punjabi
is
going
to
incorporate
a
lot
more
words
from
persian
than
hindi
so
i
dont
know
what
you
can
extrapolate
from
my
badly
written
mess
maybe
check
the
cambridge
guide
to
the
indoaryan
languages
of
course
as
i
said
in
terms
of
every
day
discourse
youre
going
to
have
to
account
for
the
fact
that
lots
of
punjabi
speakers
will
be
exposed
to
bollywood
etc
attitudes
toward
languages
used
within
a
speech
community
is
absolutely
related
to
linguistics
has
anyone
ever
done
their
phd
through
open
online
is
this
even
possible
thats
how
i
pronounce
them
too
just
out
of
interest
where
are
you
from
in
the
southeast
i
grew
up
in
the
southeast
kent
and
now
im
living
in
wiltshire
dont
normally
see
anyone
that
appears
to
be
following
me
around
the
country
i
dont
sign
but
im
having
difficulty
understanding
how
a
visual
interruption
is
much
different
than
an
auditory
interruption
when
two
people
are
speaking
at
the
same
time
the
listener
receives
both
streams
of
audio
but
it
can
be
tricky
to
separate
and
process
them
i
would
imagine
it
would
be
similar
for
visual
communication
where
the
viewer
can
see
both
people
signing
but
there
is
more
effort
needed
to
process
two
streams
of
communication
is
this
correct
thanks
some
people
actually
do
this
in
english
they
just
keep
saying
nhnm
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
to
signal
that
theyre
listening
but
usually
when
they
do
this
they
are
listening
of
the
least
bit
they
are
probably
thinking
of
football
while
their
wife
is
naggin
to
them
about
picking
up
the
kids
from
soccer
practice
or
doin
the
dishes
they
actually
had
a
funny
episode
of
tim
and
eric
awesome
show
great
job
where
you
could
put
on
a
mask
and
it
would
do
it
for
you
i
cant
remeber
what
the
episode
is
called
though
please
read
the
rules
before
posting
the
wikipeida
article
this
came
from
states
they
are
within
the
same
family
although
i
dont
personally
know
how
similar
they
are
at
least
in
spanish
thats
a
much
bigger
issue
i
dont
think
accented
vowels
appear
in
places
were
the
unaccented
version
would
be
uncommon
so
that
wouldnt
skew
the
results
too
badly
but
n
are
a
very
different
story
and
u
are
also
bad
since
the
latter
can
be
silent
in
que
qui
or
gue
gui
i
did
read
what
you
wrote
and
i
responded
to
it
i
dont
know
why
youre
making
this
so
complicated
then
again
it
was
you
who
put
words
in
my
mouth
by
quoting
representative
of
the
whole
language
something
that
i
did
not
say
why
did
you
quote
that
the
author
was
trying
to
compare
the
frequency
of
letters
in
various
positions
in
a
word
across
languages
one
reason
that
the
study
was
flawed
was
that
the
languages
use
many
different
characters
eg
with
accents
and
diacritics
which
cannot
just
be
lumped
into
the
nonaccenteddiacritically
marked
form
to
say
that
an
n
with
a
tilda
over
it
is
the
same
as
an
n
without
a
tilda
is
ridiculous
but
thats
just
what
the
study
does
if
you
do
this
then
youd
better
provide
some
explanation
for
why
you
think
its
okay
to
do
so
but
the
author
provides
none
i
just
finished
teaching
my
first
two
courses
protip
for
those
of
you
going
into
teaching
dont
do
two
new
preps
at
once
for
an
intensive
session
like
a
summer
name
i
dont
know
that
theres
really
a
good
measure
of
diversity
comparisons
can
be
made
but
its
not
like
we
can
just
check
off
boxes
and
have
a
number
its
rarely
used
in
informal
contexts
not
never
im
one
of
the
handful
that
still
has
it
it
sounds
like
morpheme
isolation
and
definition
to
me
but
many
of
the
users
on
this
subreddit
are
usually
more
read
up
on
the
subject
than
i
eh
wasnt
a
stretch
in
my
idiolect
i
didnt
know
quite
how
easy
it
was
to
use
amateur
opinion
i
think
it
might
be
due
to
our
eurocentric
nature
that
we
generally
focus
strongly
on
differences
between
european
countries
compared
to
others
which
is
reflected
in
our
perception
of
culture
and
therefore
accent
we
talk
about
the
differences
between
france
england
and
germany
and
then
view
china
and
india
as
one
homogeneous
country
and
the
chinese
as
a
homogeneous
people
our
recognition
of
accent
i
guess
tends
to
confirm
this
in
order
to
maintain
these
labels
in
our
mind
furthermore
i
think
its
also
a
question
of
habituation
and
education
we
are
much
more
exposed
to
european
languages
and
how
they
sound
generally
americans
cant
distinguish
between
british
accents
and
lump
them
together
whereas
brits
find
the
differences
within
the
country
to
be
gigantic
i
guess
this
difference
can
be
attributed
to
habituation
i
wonder
if
children
are
told
that
such
an
accent
is
not
indian
rather
a
southern
hindi
accent
or
a
congolese
accent
this
effect
would
disappear
of
course
this
would
have
to
break
down
our
western
country
bias
and
accept
the
fact
that
foreign
countries
are
not
all
that
homogeneous
after
all
this
should
go
into
the
higher
education
thread
my
guess
because
if
your
excitement
were
genuine
youd
actually
let
out
a
big
whoop
loud
cry
saying
big
whoop
is
like
saying
insert
applause
here
same
deal
with
giving
a
slow
clapthe
fact
that
the
usual
act
is
being
modified
shows
that
its
calculated
in
that
instance
instead
of
spontaneous
in
my
experience
their
opinions
about
which
languages
are
most
beautiful
are
very
diverseprobably
due
to
a
wider
exposure
to
many
languages
and
more
opportunities
to
develop
personal
preferences
but
as
malignantmouse
said
we
might
be
reluctant
to
share
those
personal
preferences
at
least
outside
our
bubble
because
we
dont
want
anyone
to
take
our
opinions
as
the
objective
truth
we
cant
study
the
objective
beauty
of
a
language
because
it
doesnt
exist
but
we
can
and
do
study
language
attitudes
this
often
falls
under
the
umbrella
of
sociolinguistics
that
means
we
can
study
what
aesthetic
judgments
people
make
and
attempt
to
discover
what
influences
those
judgements
there
are
two
major
hypotheses
people
evaluate
a
language
as
beautiful
or
not
based
on
some
intrinsic
property
of
the
language
the
inherent
value
hypothesis
people
evaluate
a
language
as
beautiful
or
not
based
on
language
attitudes
and
social
norms
social
connotations
hypothesis
this
is
the
difference
between
people
thinking
a
southern
twang
usually
difficult
for
them
to
characterize
is
ugly
because
it
has
features
that
are
intrinsically
ugly
and
people
thinking
a
southern
twang
is
ugly
because
southern
speech
is
stigmatized
the
research
suggests
that
its
the
latter
expressed
distaste
for
a
language
tends
to
correlate
with
a
negative
attitude
towards
the
speakers
of
it
for
an
accessible
overview
of
this
issue
you
can
check
out
language
myths
specifically
the
chapter
titled
italian
is
beautiful
german
is
ugly
by
giles
and
niedsielski
ah
the
ol
say
something
in
x
language
dilemma
my
mind
usually
draws
a
complete
blank
then
too
thanks
for
your
answer
i
figured
what
with
the
japanese
language
being
so
nuanced
and
their
culture
so
um
convoluted
it
had
to
be
something
along
those
lines
thank
you
so
much
funny
though
in
the
west
if
you
meet
someone
that
speaks
a
different
language
swearwords
are
often
the
first
thing
you
learn
at
least
if
youre
younger
p
that
with
the
japanese
language
being
so
nuanced
and
their
culture
so
um
convoluted
you
should
probably
reconsider
buying
into
this
stereotype
about
japanese
culture
its
basically
the
inscrutable
oriental
stereotype
which
is
rooted
in
ethnocentric
and
racist
perceptions
of
east
asia
i
know
you
mean
it
innocently
but
its
considered
pretty
offensive
by
many
japanese
culture
is
probably
not
more
nuanced
or
convoluted
than
for
example
american
cultureunless
you
define
nuanced
and
convoluted
in
an
ethnocentric
way
since
these
are
not
rigorous
terms
they
dont
really
have
a
specific
meaning
except
i
find
these
cultural
norms
exotic
and
hard
to
understand
i
would
definitely
say
things
have
genders
if
i
said
es
i
can
tell
you
youre
not
thinking
of
the
walls
or
door
and
consider
using
a
pronoun
for
mhen
i
can
bet
that
at
some
point
youd
use
something
referring
to
the
gender
of
the
referent
over
the
word
even
though
there
wouldnt
be
a
feminine
word
involved
thats
a
person
granted
but
its
still
semirelevant
its
been
awhile
since
ive
looked
at
it
but
i
believe
algeo
and
pyles
history
and
development
of
the
english
language
includes
all
that
stuff
thanks
thats
good
to
know
unfortunate
since
the
book
jacket
has
an
endorsement
from
a
philosopher
for
whom
i
have
tremendous
respect
but
hey
cant
win
them
all
i
guess
thats
more
or
less
my
use

i
will
read

i

if

people

i
apologise
if
this
is
obvious
but
your
initial
question
seems
to
convey
surprise
that
standard
languages
should
display
illogical
syntax
yet
though
seemingly
illogical
double
negation
is
of
course
widespread
crosslinguistically
the
standard
english
construction
without
verbal
negation
eg
i
saw
nobody
is
a
minority
pattern
crosslinguistically
and
with
this
crosslinguistic
background
it
becomes
quite
difficult
to
label
nonstandard
constructions
such
as
i
didnt
see
nobody
as
illogical

thanks
for
this
post
this
looks
super
interesting
they
dont
want
to
create
a

they
are
just
creating

only
tell
the

how
each

looks

they
cant
change
how
the

are

names
can
be
from
french
origin
we
are
using
them
in
tunisia
today
janvi
fivri
mars
avril
out
etc
that
depends
on
when
they
started
using
those
words
i
think
the
basic
idea
is
that
you
can
enter
phonemes
and
their
allophones
here
you
can
see
an
example
for
searching
for
languages
in
the
sample
that
have
as
a
surface
realisation
for
g
note
that
i
flagged
one
segment
with
and
the
other
with
and
then
specified
that
i
only
wanted
rules
where
theres
a
ton
of
other
features
you
can
specify
the
environment
the
kind
of
change
eg
plosive
to
fricative
etc
looks
good
but
itd
be
eg
interesting
to
see
the
language
sample
used
for
this
and
also
how
extensively
the
phonology
of
the
single
languages
was
described
this
is
more
appropriate
at
rbadlinguistics
it
doesnt
belong
here
nope
exactly
the
same
thanks
for
all
the
comments
guys
it
is
really
interesting
to
hear
all
the
different
variation
inside
usa
i
didnt
realise
who
different
the
speech
was
across
the
country
could
anyone
post
a
video
of
spanish
spoken
in
barcelona
by
catalanspeakers
i
suppose
most
natives
from
barcelona
also
have
catalan
as
a
mother
tongue
correct
me
if
im
wrong
are
these
interferences
from
catalan
accepted
or
are
people
taught
to
speak
a
different
form
of
spanish
gosh
thank
you
so
much
thank
you
for
iding
what
im
looking
for
gestures
the
aan
distinction
is
motivated
by
phonological
environment
not
by
agreement
it
is
similar
to
s
z
and
z
in
the
words
cats
dogs
and
judges
if
you
like
these
kid
of
alternations
you
might
want
to
look
into
morphophonemics
im
not
exactly
sure
how
to
phrase
this
question
so
please
bear
with
me
heres
a
little
background
info
i
have
experience
teaching
esl
to
students
from

noticed

interesting
that
happens
with
many
nonnative
speakers
when
speaking
english
for
example
many
native
german
speakers
tend
to
pronounce
the
english
w
as
v
which
is
understandable
considering
that
in
german
v
is
pronounced
as
w
however
many
native
german
speakers
also
pronounce
the
english
v
as
w
village
becomes
willage
for
example
which
makes
little
sense
considering
that
the
german
v
is
pronounced
more
like
a
hard
f
sound
i
assume
that
this
is
a
false
largely
unconscious
assumption
that
the
letters
replace
one
another
in
both
cases
another
example
many
native
japanese
speakers
add
an
extra
vowel
sound
to
syllables
ending
in
consonants
so
as
to
ease
pronunciation
for
example
mcdonalds
sounds
something
like
makadonasu
however
in
certain
cases
japanese
speakers
also
tend
to
delete
vowel
sounds
at
the
end
of
some
english
or
often
spanishderived
words
tornado
is
rendered
as
tornad
while
orlando
is
orland
my
question
is
is
there
a
name
for
this
phenomenon
in
which
one
rule
about
pronunciation
is
falsely
conflated
to
include
the
opposite
case
and
furthermore
can
anyone
give
more
examples
of
this
phenomenon
i
hope
this
question
is
clear
and
i
appreciate
any
input
as
posted
on
language
log
some
more
of
jurafskys
publications
on
the
language
of
food
are
found
on
his
website
for
those
interested
productionwise
the
articulators
are
all
in
the
same
position
they
would
be
in
for
a
voiced
vowel
only
theres
no
modal
voicing
having
no
vowel
would
mean
the
articulators
go
directly
from
consonant
to
consonant
with
no
intermediate
vowel
target
im
not
sure
what
impact
this
has
on
the
spectrogram
edit
spelling
are
you
thinking
of
verb
trennbare
verben
not
that
fast
english
is
still
my
second
language
id
say
youre
nouning
a
verbed
noun
i
just
gathered
everything
i
could
find
that
touched
on
blends
from
a
few
peoples
bibliographies
and
i
had
to
organize
my
reading
schedule
for
the
independent
study
some
kind
of
way
so
my
advisor
suggested
chronologically
i
didnt
actually
know
that
the
morphological
blends
parts
of
the
book
were
more
marginal
until
i
started
reading
besides
he
does
say
a
fair
amount
that
seems
to
be
about
morphological
blends
the
next
piece
im
doing
is
louise
pounds
1914
blends
and
their
relation
to
english
wordformation
if
i
remember
the
title
correctly
thanks
for
the
headsup
about
the
use
of
felicity
ill
see
how
else
i
can
state
it
youre
right
it
is
pretty
subjective
as
it
stands
if
my
research
tends
in
that
direction
ill
have
to
clarify
what
i
mean
significantly
and
operationalize
the
concept
im
super
excited
about
digirolamos
work
its
currently
scheduled
for
the
end
of
the
semester
but
i
will
probably
read
it
sooner
than
that
in
addition
to
what
keyilan
said
you
need
to
be
extremely
wary
of
the
effects
of
prosody
which
can
interact
with
tone
you
cant
truly
elicit
words
in
isolation
so
instead
elicit
target
words
in
different
contexts
eg
phrase
initially
finally
medially
you
can
also
elicit
words
in
lists
to
help
sort
this
out
im
not
saying
words
in
isolation
are
uselessi
use
them
a
lot
for
dictionary
workbut
you
need
figure
out
what
youre
hearing
first
but
congratulations
on
finding
minimal
pairs
im
studying
a
tone
language
with
up
to
six
tones
and
there
are
no
minimal
triplets
for
even
just
the
three
level
tones
for
the
phonetic
analysis
of
the
tone
lots
of
tokens
of
example
words
is
useful
just
because
prosody
is
so
variable
you
will
start
to
see
the
constants
you
want
to
gather
these
tokens
over
an
extended
period
of
time
to
avoid
repetition
effects
you
dont
want
to
limit
yourself
to
looking
at
just
a
few
words
but
its
a
good
way
to
get
an
idea
of
what
the
phonetics
of
these
tones
are
when
youre
first
starting
out
and
also
beware
of
misinterpreting
i
have
no
idea
how
you
elicited
these
but
make
sure
you
arent
eg
hearing
a
difference
in
tone
between
two
words
and
not
checking
to
see
if
this
difference
is
persistent
through
other
sessions
and
that
the
speaker
is
actually
hearing
two
different
words
thanks
for
participating
and
for
your
feedback
you
are
right
i
dont
understand
could
you
elaborate
in
a
language
where
words
are
masculine
or
feminine
then
the
the
different
articles
would
become
more
closely
associated
with
the
noun
making
it
perhaps
more
likely
that
the
definite
or
indefinite
article
gets
carried
across
with
the
noun
when
the
word
is
borrowed
by
another
language
im
only
guessing
here
as
a
native
russian
speaker
for
i
decided
to
not
to
to
work
tomorrow
i
could
say
i
decided
nonot
goinf
onto
work
tomorrow
though
id
feel
more
natural
throwing
tomorrow
in
somewhere
else
in
the
sentence
eg
this
piece
is
geared
more
towards
nonlinguists
i
think
but
an
interesting
read
nonetheless
id
love
to
see
people
who
could
post
any
sources
that
either
support
or
refute
some
of
his
claims
there
was
an
interesting
discussion
a
few
weeks
back
regarding
language
death
being
driven
by
economic
success
that
this
article
adds
a
bit
of
discussion
to
flex
is
absolutely
great
at
the
two
things
it
was
designed
for
compiling
a
lexicon
for
dictionary
production
and
glossing
texts
as
in
monologic
narratives
dyadic
conversations
not
so
much
unfortunately
these
were
initially
designed
as
two
fairly
separate
tasks
so
there
are
kinks
when
users
dont
realize
this
about
certain
fields
they
use
but
flex
is
getting
better
with
every
new
release
theres
really
active
support
for
it
which
is
great
and
yeah
toolbox
is
pretty
outdated
now
i
resisted
upgrading
for
awhile
but
flex
really
is
so
much
better
despite
the
kinks
ive
never
tried
miromaa
though
which
is
gaining
support
the
concept
in
the
arab
world
that
dialects
are
not
arabic
found
is
a
peculiar
one
but
somewhat
predictable
a
common
feature
of
diglossia
is
that
the
basilect
is
described
as
illegitimate
or
inferior
as
far
as
which
dialect
is
closest
to
msa
it
is
somewhat
comic
that
almost
every
region
in
the
mashreq
claims
that
their
dialect
is
the
closest
to
classical
arabic
but
i
dont
think
these
kinds
of
statements
make
any
sense
because
the
dialects
are
most
likely
not
directly
descended
from
fu
but
rather
from
an
unspoken
medieval
koine
ferguson
so
the
question
ought
to
be
which
dialect
has
preserved
the
greatest
number
of
features
of
that
koine
surely
all
of
them
have
preserved
some
things
and
lost
other
things
each
in
their
own
way
of
course
the
fact
that
it
was
unwritten
makes
that
rather
difficult
to
judge
im
a
masters
student
in
computational
linguistics
in
france
and
im
most
interested
in
second
language
teachinglearning
my
second
semester
is
a
6
month
research
project
and
for
either
that
or
afterwards
perhaps
for
a
phd
im
wondering
which
unisresearch
groups
are
leaders
can
be
anywhere
huh
didnt
know
that
exists
the
language
construction
kit
by
mark
rosenfelder
the
end
goal
is
to
create
a
constructed
language
but
he
does
a
good
job
of
hitting
the
major
areas
and
explaining
them
first
this
is
something
that
i
do
born
raised
living
in
nyc
sometimes
repond
with
answer
my
answer
when
asked
of
me
by
fellow
college
students
most
who
are
residents
of
brooklyn
i
think
the
subjunctive
form
has
the
same
meaning
but
sounds
more
formal
the
infinitivo
pessoal
form
is
a
simpler
way
of
expressing
the
same
thing
since
it
doesnt
require
preposition
and
conjugating
the
verb
in
presente
or
pretrito
imperfeito
do
subjuntivo
this
is
hardly
representative
of
the
way
scots
talk
normally
done
thats
what
ug
sets
out
to
be
specifically
i
dont
agree
with
the
notion
that
turing
architecture
doesnt
apply
to
the
brain
when
we
accept
that
the
brain
can
generate
recursive
structures
which
by
the
very
definition
of
the
process
are
potentially
infinite
then
it
reasonable
to
think
that
the
system
can
operate
within
physical
constraints
both
in
terms
of
processing
speed
and
memory
capacity
for
our
regular
usage
of
language
thats
just
a
theory
of
course
but
its
the
best
i
know
of
all
other
methods
that
have
been
proposed
quite
a
few
just
dont
seem
to
hold
up
under
scrutiny
chomsky
actually
coauthored
a
paper
not
long
ago
on
this
specific
topic
i
have
had
comments
like
this
before
on
reddit
the
written
scots
ye
might
see
is
very
poor
at
conveying
the
actual
language
imo
if
scots
has
an
english
cognate
then
some
people
just
write
the
english
word
and
the
written
scots
is
mire
affected
by
english
due
to
scots
being
mostly
only
spoken
in
response
to
that
i
recorded
myself
saying
some
usuall
scots
dilouge
and
posted
it
on
reddit
those
who
said
they
could
understand
scots
had
no
clue
what
i
said
ill
post
a
link
when
im
home
take
the
scots
you
see
written
on
the
internet
with
a
pinch
of
salt
and
close
french
wikipedia
as
a
barbarous
latin
spoken
by
savages
heh
the
statistics
at
the
bottom
of
the
article
with
85
of
scots
claiming
to
know
scots
ought
to
be
enough
to
justify
the
existence
of
a
scots
wiki
if
there
can
be
a
norfuk
one
which
caters
to
about
900
people
then
trying
to
get
rid
of
a
scots
one
makes
little
sense
edit
corrected
3000
speakers
to
900
im
rarer
than
i
thought
same
thing
though
itll
eventually
just
come
down
to
how
they
feel
about
southern
people
where
was
this
yes
i
think
she
andor
other
people
with
that
same
experience
should
be
the
ones
to
make
it
stop
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
someone
like
me
white
welloff
collegeeducated
having
any
say
in
that
issue
its
not
my
story
are
you
arguing
that
go
in
this
context
is
light
it
seems
very
much
to
have
a
meaning
still
go
away
is
a
part
of
the
expression
thats
a
different
take
on
lvcs
which
are
usually
more
like
take
a
walk
perform
a
surgery
etc
wouldnt
we
expect
true
svcs
to
be
valid
in
the
grammar
outside
of
a
limited
instance
lets
take
go
fuck
yourself
1
same
arguments
is
a
curious
criterion
they
should
be
able
to
share
a
subject
and
have
different
complements
eg
jamaican
im
tek
naif
kot
mi
he
took
a
knife
and
cut
me
go
fuck
yourself
cannot
be
broken
up
in
the
same
way
for
example
go
home
fuck
yourself
is
bad
2
same
temporality
only
applies
in
one
tense
he
went
fucked
himself
is
bad
4
english
is
a
good
help
here
he
goes
fucks
himself
is
bad
while
he
can
go
fuck
himself
is
okay
so
theres
something
there
that
shows
its
not
limited
to
the
imperative
but
it
is
limited
in
other
ways
also
even
though
come
is
another
possible
serializer
come
get
food
come
make
my
toes
curl
etc
come
and
fuck
yourself
are
seemingly
incompatible
come
fuck
yourself
i
suspect
that
what
were
looking
at
is
a
pair
of
modals
possibly
in
development
but
it
hardly
seems
compatible
with
an
svc
analysis
my
edit
was
just
giving
newmeyer
1986s
own
answer
to
the
question
he
rises
in
his
title
i
dont
have
any
response
to
phonology
youre
wellaware
im
ignorant
of
that
subfield
p
not
that
i
mind
linguistics
is
linguistics
i
think
it
would
better
serve
everybody
if
we
had
places
where
you
could
examine
each
school
in
its
own
right
if
all
the
sidebars
were
flush
with
intro
info
and
the
posts
interesting
and
relevent
even
if
they
arent
updated
often
then
it
would
be
great
for
everybody
to
see
what
all
linguistics
has
to
offer
first
the
apostrophe
isnt
part
of
the
word
and
theres
no
such
letter
or
diacritic
in
northern
saami
theres
a
similarlooking
diacritic
in
linguistics
signifying
overlong
grade
like
a
father
which
is
in
modern
orthography
hi
this
high
bar
is
sometimes
writen
in
dictionaries
eg
hi
to
signify
the
grade
but
it
isnt
part
of
modern
official
orthography
second
and
i
have
no
actual
sources
here
the
russian
word
is
derived
by
wiktionary
from
old
church
slavonic
french
du
vieux
slave
its
the
iterative
of
what
modern
russian
word
is
so
theyre
presumably
related
what
the
lgu
database
says
of
vuodjit
the
word
family
is
etymologised
to
be
a
loan
from
indoeuropean
latin
ago
is
from
the
same
stem
and
wiktionary
lists
the
root
as
h
note
that
lgu
gives
the
protosaami
as
vj
which
implies
either
a
either
short
or
long
or
long
in
previous
forms
if
im
not
mistaken
i
dont
know
whether
the
first
vowel
was
long
in
older
slavic
forms
so
but
when
the
sound
correspondence
is
completely
regular
between
saami
and
finnic
thats
the
more
parsimonous
explanation
edit
i
should
also
note
that
apparently
the
prosthetic
v
happened
in
protosaami
before
o
i
think
its
this
one
ive
loved
these
ever
since
i
got
kicked
out
of
spanish
class
in
6th
grade
for
having
a
laughing
fit
at
the
textbook
the
dog
with
the
speech
bubble
saying
guau
guau
and
the
cow
saying
m
were
just
too
much
a
lot
of
those
korean
ones
are
not
at
all
evocative
though
im
pretty
familiar
with
korean
pronunciation
and
stillji
geul
for
eggs
frying
remarkably
as
the
language
passed
from
one
learner
to
the
next
it
began
to
acquire
cogent
structure
i
sense
that
the
fact
that
the
participants
already
have
language
would
be
a
strong
confounding
factor
in
this
experiment
how
do
we
know
they
were
generating
novel
structure
in
a
way
that
mirrors
the
evolution
of
language
and
not
scaffolding
new
structure
from
their
existing
linguistic
knowledge
i
think
heshe
means
that
theyre
trying
to
get
them
to
pronounce
those
words
as
something
like
w
b
and
md
like
in
bbc
english
now
im
curious
how
you
pronounce
them
where
can

thank
you
for
your
help
i
used
codecademy
dive
into
python
and
learn
python
the
hard
way
off
and
on
i
used
r
to
map
everything
but
learned
that
basically
by
reading
the
documentation
a
couple
of
mapping
tutorials
and
trial
and
error
what
are
the
best
resources
for
learning
about
the
spread
of
pie
its
really
hard
to
find
this
for
free
and
im
not
familiar
with
any
that
are
outside
of
just
googling
and
picking
which
one
you
like
best
if
you
google
english
word
frequency
you
get
quite
a
lot
of
hits
i
would
say
maybe
find
as
large
of
a
corpus
as
youd
like
and
check
out
some
hints
in
unix
for
poets
as
to
how
you
could
output
the
form
you
want
to
a
document
from
a
maclinux
command
line
or
cygwin
if
youre
familiar
with
python
there
are
plenty
of
easy
ways
to
do
this
as
well
isnt
the
situation
with
arte
and
other
similar
words
like
agua
or
ave
a
little
different
than
changing
genders
between
numbers
though
because
for
instance
they
take
masculine
agreements
before
the
word
itself
but
feminine
agreements
after
i
think
it
was
originally
meant
to
avoid
hiatus
between
la
and
agua
for
instance
one
would
more
likely
say
el
agua
fr
than
el
agua
fro
right
i
think
op
meant
if
we
ignore
the
common
origin
of
the
two
tongues
and
compared
them
as
they
are
known
today
could
we
tell
they
are
related
and
would
we
classify
them
as
such
its
not
what
you
want
but
theres
a
fair
chance
that
education
in
classical
arabic
would
make
it
easier
for
modern
speakers
waiting
for
someone
to
shoot
me
down
over
this
one
please
go
ahead
the
difference
between
the
two
is
similar
to
croatian
and
serbian
chinese
is
different
chinese
is
a
language
group
with
mandarin
cantonese
etc
being
distinct
chinese
languages
standard
urdu
is
actually
closer
to
standard
hindi
than
any
of
those
other
hindi
dialects
are
theres
this
paper
which
applies
similar
statistical
methods
to
tweets
they
found
slightly
more
than
3
bits
per
character
for
english
sorry
but
this
isnt
the
right
subreddit
you
might
want
to
try
one
thats
focused
on
english
advice
or
a
thesaurus
maybe
wordnet
once
you
do
a
search
click
where
it
says
s
and
click
around
in
there
to
see
the
full
results
can
confirm
99
of
the
time
the
endings
sound
the
same
for
the
singular
pronouns
and
often
the
third
person
plural
as
well
source
speak
french
absolutely
here
you
go
listened
to
it
several
times
im
definitely
realizing
it
as
a
voiceless
flap
and
ive
heard
other
people
around
where
im
from
california
do
this
too
youre
absolutely
right
most
of
the
characteristics
of
puerto
rican
spanish
she
mentioned
as
being
influenced
by
the
languages
of
the
slaves
brought
over
to
the
caribbean
dont
originate
from
the
slaves
at
all
that
being
said
there
is
an
undeniable
african
influence
in
the
language
of
puerto
rico
and
other
caribbean
countries
for
that
matter
mofongo
guineo
mondongo
etc
are
all
of
african
origin
however
where
you
see
the
most
african
influence
is
in
the
rhythm
of
puerto
rican
dominican
and
cuban
spanish
not
only
rhythm
in
language
but
rhythm
in
music
as
well
i
also
like
the
point
you
made
about
parts
of
rural
colombia
dropping
the
d
however
it
is
important
to
remember
that
colombias
northern
coast
is
right
on
the
caribbean
sea
and
if
im
not
mistaken
was
also
colonized
at
least
in
part
by
the
same
region
of
spain
that
puerto
rico
was
please
feel
free
to
correct
me
if
im
wrong
im
more
than
open
to
input
i
myself
am
from
puerto
rico
and
have
african
and
tano
roots
i
hold
a
deep
love
for
the
language
history
and
culture
of
my
island
and
of
the
caribbean
as
a
whole
its
always
nice
to
learn
something
new
about
your
own
ethnicity
my
path
to
getting
here
im
a
technical
editor
and
my
company
will
pay
for
its
employees
to
get
a
degree
as
long
as
it
pertains
to
their
job
a
former
coworker
got
her
ma
in
linguistics
and
i
became
fascinated
with
the
subject
so
though
linguistics
and
editing
arent
totally
intertwined
theyre
related
enough
for
the
company
to
shell
out
the
money
im
not
looking
to
move
jobs
after
i
get
my
degree
im
just
interested
in
the
subject
teaching
is
always
one
type
of
job
though
youll
need
more
than
a
masters
i
know
that
my
university
is
interested
in
hiring
professors
specializing
in
psycholinguistics
and
historical
linguistics
and
that
students
are
interested
in
both
classes
however
the
department
just
doesnt
have
the
money
to
hire
additional
professors
what
universities
in
europe
offer
good
programs
for
linguistics
either
ma
or
phd
with
a
focus
on
chinese
with
a
preference
for
universities
that
are
free
or
have
low
tuition
if
you
want
to
be
that
needlessly
pedantic
i
feel
the
need
to
point
out
scientific
being
the
key
word
professional
interpretation
is
not
science
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
video
was
as
far
from
relevant
to
the
subs
interests
as
you
can
be
while
still
talking
about
language
in
the
vaguest
sense
japanese
has
a
standard
plain
form
ie
unconjugated
ending
which
is
the
nonpast
form
there
is
no
equivalent
form
to
the
infinitive
by
nonamerican
do
you
really
just
mean
european
or
can
it
be
anywhere
for
a
classics
student
i
would
never
recommend
that
evanslevinson
article
especially
one
wanting
to
focus
on
the
latin
modern
romance
change
el
is
a
provocative
paper
within
a
broader
debate
that
requires
a
solid
background
in
linguistics
to
fully
comprehend
arch
irony
oh
oh
its
because
you
have
flat
feet
right
note
theres
no
limit
to
how
mean
the
specgram
editors
will
be
to
each
othernot
that
this
was
particularly
mean
apocryphal
anecdote
that
ill
just
drop
off
louis
hjelmslev
is
giving
a
talk
john
firth
is
in
the
audience
getting
progressively
more
annoyed
with
the
increasing
level
of
abstraction
and
lack
of
concrete
examples
as
hjelmslev
introduces
yet
another
symbol
that
generalises
some
preceding
definitions
firth
bursts
out
yes
louis
youre
very
stratospheric
hjelmslev
without
missing
a
beat
responds
no
john
youre
stratospheric
i
have
no
ceiling
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
thank
you
so
much
and
to
think
my
so
laughed
at
me
when
i
said
i
was
going
to
ask
reddit
for
help
on
my
dissertation
thank
you
your
answers
helped
me
and
is
my
dialect
or
any
surrounding
ones
dont
have
i
dont
understand
what
you
mean
when
you
say
between
y
and
and
what
is
sandhi
i
see
thank
you
i
have
also
observed
omgggggg
fmllllllll
and
the
like
haha
truthfully
the
only
class
that
gave
me
a
better
understanding
of
the
content
covered
in
the
documentary
was
linguistics
when
i
really
think
about
it
this
would
be
a
better
question
for
our
weekly
qa
threadrlinguisticsaboutsticky
do
you
mind
asking
it
again
there
thanks
you
may
want
to
wait
until
the
new
thread
goes
up
monday
morning
so
people
have
a
chance
to
see
it
your
post
has
already
been
deleted
there
is
no
need
to
delete
it
yourself
there
definitely
are
a
lot
of
folks
out
there
working
on
that
right
now
a
bunch
of
people
have
done
work
on
morphological
processing
in
patients
with
certain
kinds
of
aphasias
which
i
think
is
particularly
fascinating
theres
so
much
to
be
done
when
making
a
standard
writing
method
if
youre
not
the
government
you
must
follow
how
people
write
or
nobody
will
use
your
method
so
for
the
word
drja
drj
everyone
write
it
drja
so
if
we
come
and
tell
them
to
write
it
darja
or
drj
nobody
will
follow
what
you
said
so
you
cant
really
merge
them
in
one
phoneme
btw
you
can
take
a
look
on
phonemes
of
this
method
here
also
im
not
sure
that
there
is
no
minimal
pairs
for
and
we
didnt
finish
the
standard
dictionary
yet
oh
wait
i
found
one
elby
and
elbay
submission
statement
having
read
a
bit
about
maya
hieroglyphics
i
was
surprised
to
find
i
recognized
some
iconography
at
a
chipotle
so
i
did
an
unreasonable
amount
of
research
on
a
frivolous
topic
including
contacting
one
of
the
leading
scholars
on
maya
glyphs
mods
i
feel
like
im
submitting
a
lot
so
let
me
know
if
i
need
to
cut
it
out
can
someone
please
explain
for
me
what
the
principles
and
parameters
of
universal
grammar
are
my
textbooks
are
leaving
me
at
a
total
blank
does
it
really
matter
yes
you
cant
use
the
same
letter
for
there
is
really
a
difference
but
and
can
be
merged
in
one
letter
maltese
the
cousin
of
tunisian
uses
e
for
when
speaking
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
tin
and
khedmt
in
algerian
libyan
and
moroccan
maybe
there
is
no
difference
their
proposed
methods
of
writing
use
only
a
but
in
tunisian
there
is
a
big
difference
i
listened
to
the
audio
and
thats
definitely
an
thanks
i
dont
know
why
it
seems
hard
to
me
a
native
speaker
to
listen
to
the
right
sound
of
the
word
the
one
on
your
page
is
still
incomplete
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
needs
only
some
little
changes
but
what
do
you
exactly
mean
by
incomplete
i
mean
whats
messing
all
pages
of
alphabets
of
other
spoken
languages
eg
moroccan
are
the
same
when
was
pashtun
lands
introduced
to
the
pashtun
language
which
is
an
eastern
iranian
language
was
an
indoaryan
language
spoken
there
before
iranian
languages
were
spoken
there
im
very
familiar
with
the
pashtuns
being
an
ancient
ethnic
group
theyre
even
mentioned
in
the
rig
vedas
see
pactya
is
it
possible
that
they
were
indoaryan
before
becoming
iranianized
i
mean
you
can
do
that
many
problems
only
unicode
fonts
will
support
our
language
tunisian
is
the
language
of
the
web
its
build
on
the
web
so
it
must
be
widely
supported
many
letters
not
easy
to
write
etc
so
not
using
them
can
lead
to
lesser
support
problems
these
would
then
be
written
the
same
way
so
why
do
we
have
diacritics
qsir
qsr
qsr
qsr
qsr
im
just
saying
you
might
wanna
reconsider
to
not
distinguish
some
phonemes
of
the
language
when
writing
yes
this
a
problem
but
weve
two
limits
web
support
and
users
knowledge
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
write
every
phonemes
in
our
language
but
you
cant
use
so
many
letters
people
never
saw
or
letters
computers
and
phones
never
saw
you
always
ask
me
about
minimal
pairs
if
weve
many
minimal
pairs
for
two
vowels
does
that
mean
that
we
must
distinguish
them
also
youre
the
best
redditor
ive
ever
met
thank
you
evolving
and
dying
are
two
very
different
things
evolving
means
that
the
language
is
being
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation
with
some
changes
dying
means
that
the
normal
course
of
language
transmission
from
one
generation
to
the
other
has
been
disrupted
language
death
almost
always
involves
some
sort
of
coercion
from
outside
the
culture
such
as
economic
opportunities
denied
to
speakers
of
certain
languages
myths
about
the
importance
of
monolingualism
in
another
cultures
language
outright
threats
of
violence
disparagement
of
the
value
of
their
language
etc
you
should
really
confuse
people
by
having
a
scottish
accent
or
something
equally
surprising
the
first
thing
to
know
is
that
the
ipa
isnt
sounds
its
symbols
that
represent
categories
of
sounds
its
more
important
to
understand
how
the
ipa
chart
is
designed
than
to
memorize
all
of
the
symbols
do
you
know
what
place
of
articulation
means
do
you
know
the
difference
between
different
glottal
statesvoiceless
modal
breathy
creaky
do
you
know
what
manner
of
articulation
means
if
i
say
voiceless
palatal
fricative
do
you
know
what
sound
i
mean
can
you
provide
a
description
of
the
way
it
is
produced
this
is
far
more
important
than
knowing
the
symbol
for
a
voiceless
palatal
fricative
is
so
the
way
to
study
the
ipa
is
to
study
basic
articulatory
phonetics
and
then
to
understand
how
the
chart
is
laid
out
if
youre
taking
a
course
and
you
need
to
memorize
individual
ipa
symbols
then
the
best
way
in
my
opinion
is
to
make
flash
cards
the
front
side
the
symbol
the
back
side
the
articulatory
description
if
you
are
doing
productionperception
exams
an
example
is
good
to
include
so
you
can
hearmimic
a
sound
if
its
an
english
sound
include
an
english
word
on
the
same
side
as
the
definition
if
its
not
find
an
example
of
a
language
that
has
that
sound
and
use
that
computer
flash
cards
are
great
in
this
case
because
you
can
embed
audio
files
yeah
this
is
just
like
when
a
caterpillar
that
turns
into
a
butterfly
is
still
called
a
caterpillar
right
maybe
its
a
difference
in
perception
based
on
location
one
is
primary
used
in
american
english
and
the
other
british
english
if
im
not
mistaken
turkish
no
doubt
there
is
a
standard
way
to
do
this
among
linguists
but
ill
give
it
a
go
amerikali

edit
format
thank
you
for
the
information
i
thought
piraha
language
didnt
have
recursive
structures
so
how
can
it
be
said
that
recursion
is
a
native
quality
that
all
languages
share
according
to
one
linguist
others
have
examined
the
data
and
have
concluded
that
there
is
recursion
this
is
still
up
for
debate
but
i
dont
really
think
itll
be
resolved
until
somebody
other
than
everett
does
substantial
work
with
the
piraha
well
so
i
didnt
go
to
brown
but
as
i
understand
it
they
lump
linguistics
in
with
cognitive
sciences
and
psychology
so
theyre
good
with
that
sort
of
stuff
and
if
youre
interested
in
categorial
grammar
well
thats
a
good
place
to
learn
about
that
haha
though
i
dont
really
associate
it
that
much
with
historical
linguistics
as
i
do
with
say
harvard
not
a
linguist
but
french
france
native
speaker
i
tried
to
understand
what
happens
in
my
brain
when
i
speak
i
rarely
use
cenci
it
sounds
a
bit
oldfashioned
well
now
i
realise
i
use
cette
fois
ci
to
mean
this
time
if
its
about
now
and
cette
fois
l
in
the
sense
that
other
time
but
few
situations
call
for
a
ci
for
the
use
or
omission
of
lci
it
sounds
awkward
for
me
to
not
say
l
if
the
cenl
thing
is
the
last
element
of
the
sentence
i
wouldnt
say
je
prre
cette
lampe
i
would
probably
go
for
je
prre
cette
lampe
l
or
je
lai
lu
dans
ce
livre
l
but
cest
dans
ce
livre
que
je
lai
lu
sounds
natural
if
its
in
this
order
out
of
the
cinema
ce
film
tait
vraiment
mauvais
point
at
poster
of
other
movie
ce
film
l
a
lair
beaucoup
mieux
but
here
its
more
in
a
this
onethat
one
sense
because
the
noun
has
been
pronounced
in
the
previous
sentence
ce
mec
conduit
vraiment
mal
tu
crois
quil
a
bu
je
tai
dj
dit
de
ne
pas
parler
avec
ces
gens
l
cette
voiture
l
cest
la
mienne
has
the
value
of
a
this
here
car
is
mine
but
again
ira
pour
cette
fois
is
the
phrasing
most
people
would
use
edit
after
reading
the
other
comment
i
also
remember
that
when
we
want
to
imitate
a
stereotypical
qu
speech
we
add
random
l
at
the
end
of
propositions
so
we
may
have
slightly
different
habits
there
i
think
its
a
fallacy
to
say
that
the
brain
encodes
wordsgrammardiscourse
just
because
machine
learning
can
differentiate
those
processes
the
brain
is
doing
a
lot
at
any
given
point
in
time
and
data
preprocessing
really
matters
when
doing
machine
learning
over
brain
data
it
is
also
not
solid
reasoning
and
i
would
be
surprised
that
the
authors
would
ever
claim
this
that
just
because
those
areas
are
getting
increased
blood
flow
which
is
what
fmri
indirectly
measures
during
tasks
that
we
think
are
related
to
lexical
accessparsingdiscourse
processing
does
not
mean
that
those
areas
are
active
in
fact
it
could
be
the
case
that
those
areas
are
being
inhibited
and
dont
encode
anything
plus
if
youll
look
the
regions
they
identified
take
up
a
good
half
of
auditory
and
prefrontal
cortex
thats
not
exactly
a
good
sign
in
terms
of
localization
thats
an
obscenely
large
number
of
neurons
the
short
answer
is
that
they
wouldnt
necessarily
need
to
interact
if
youre
looking
at
tonogenesis
as
the
result
of
the
coda
consonant
ie
whats
usually
presented
as
the
source
of
vietnamese
tones
and
chinese
contour
tones
then
theres
no
reason
it
needs
to
affect
the
pitchstress
accent
system
the
two
can
coexist
what
makes
you
think
its
nonstandard
as
per
my
explanation
its
a
usage
which
i
and
everyone
whos
had
a
similar
education
to
me
i
think
everyone
who
speaks
english
has
used
since
childhood
if
you
disagree
you
need
to
find
another
way
to
account
for
the
fact
we
identify
such
words
as
things
as
unessie
said
above
how
is
a
process
not
a
thing
its
just
totally
intuitive
do
you
disagree
that
combustion
is
a
thing
what
does
thing
mean
that
noun
doesnt
why
does
it
need
to
of
course
thing
also
has
a
range
of
other
meanings
as
mentioned
some
of
those
are
archetypal
nouns
thats
why
the
word
is
useful
for
simple
explanations
arguably
its
much
easier
to
say
nouns
are
things
like
a
chair
or
a
table
and
nonphysical
things
like
an
emotion
at
which
point
most
people
just
get
it
than
say
nouns
are
words
which
bear
a
certain
syntactic
relationship
whats
that
to
other
words
for
example
if
you
can
use
an
article
whats
that
in
front
of
a
word
and
its
not
an
adjective
or
an
adverb
what
are
they
then
its
a
noun
this
is
content
right
here
thank
you
so
much
i
wouldnt
worry
too
much
about
how
often
youre
presenting
although
not
presenting
at
all
is
probably
not
the
best
if
there
are
any
conferences
in
your
subfield
happening
near
you
definitely
consider
applying
with
some
smaller
conferences
the
organizers
can
help
you
find
a
grad
student
or
someone
to
stay
with
for
the
duration
of
the
conference
which
can
help
reduce
costs
its
worth
looking
into
anything
that
necessarily
involves
airplanes
is
probably
a
onceayear
kind
of
endeavor
at
most
unless
your
department
has
a
lot
of
travel
funding
as
umalignantmouse
said
conferences
are
expensive
probably
consider
those
only
if
its
a
really
wellattended
conference
or
if
theres
a
special
sessiontopic
thats
especially
relevant
to
your
work
no
one
expects
you
to
go
broke
for
the
sake
of
conferences
isnt
brazil
limiting
the
contact
with
natives
at
least
thats
last
that
i
saw
of
it
for
me
they
are
all
the
same
except
for
spy
which
i
say
im
not
a
native
though
so
what
are
some
features
that
no
language
should
have
according
to
that
toolbox
some
claims
included
in
this
article
just
make
no
sense
once
you
understand
that
the
linguistic
diversity
is
not
an
obstacle
to
this
approach
its
the
whole
point
the
linguistic
diversity
comes
from
the
combination
of
the
tools
it
is
its
an
obstacle
to
the
claim
that
grammar
is
somewhat
hardwired
to
the
brain
if
that
hardwiring
doesnt
reduce
the
allowed
grammars
to
a
small
subset
of
all
practically
usable
grammars
it
cant
solve
the
poverty
of
stimulus
and
there
has
to
be
another
explanation
every
language
family
has
been
studied
by
generativists
so
the
claim
that
we
would
be
astonished
by
the
linguistic
diversity
ie
that
we
dont
look
at
these
languages
is
more
than
missing
the
point
its
insulting
i
thing
that
this
criticism
comes
from
the
observation
that
english
and
similar
languages
tend
to
have
reasonable
structure
while
very
different
langauges
often
need
cumbersome
rules
scrambling
and
so
on
i
agree
the
vowel
is
always
nasalized
i
just
didnt
mark
it
originally
because
i
thought
it
was
assumed
that
english
vowels
preceding
nasals
become
nas
thanks
for
the
input
though
im
from
the
midlands
and
i
have
something
like
an
note
the
glottals
syllable
final
glottalisation
of
stops
is
a
feature
for
many
younger
british
english
speakers
the
d
isnt
deleted
its
glottalised
i
dont
know
of
any
special
interaction
between
nasals
and
rhotics
glottal
stops
count
as
consonants
can
you
hear
them
not
really
but
it
slightly
modifies
the
way
i
pronounce
the
vowel
before
it
tone
1
is
way
way
more
frequent
and
clearly
the
default
tone
while
thats
the
traditional
majority
view
op
is
reading
wetterlin
2010
which
argues
precisely
the
opposite
the
intent
of
this
book
is
to
challenge
the
firmly
established
view
that
in
scandinavian
tonal
dialects
accent
2
is
the
lexically
specified
word
accent
it
instead
proposes
that
accent
1
historically
was
and
today
still
is
the
lexical
accent
ie
the
one
that
does
not
follow
rules
and
has
to
be
stored
in
the
lexicon
its
also
theoretical
physics
although
to
be
fair
at
the
time
einstein
was
doing
his
work
there
wasnt
really
the
split
between
physicsapplied
math
that
exists
today
great
to
see
it
up
as
a
topic
yeah
that
sounds
fine
to
me
thanks
i
will
yes
i
see
it
said
when
people
from
europe
are
talking
about
medical
services
same
with
some
educational
references
like
when
i
was
at
university
they
just
drop
the
article
as
if
it
was
a
universal
institution
that
has
no
distinction
this
is
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
acknowledgement
of
its
existence
and
a
guideline
for
where
to
and
not
to
use
it
thanks
as
a
native
english
speaker
i
can
definitely
discern
a
slight
difference
in
the
accents
of
my
professors
from
the
north
eg
brest
paris
versus
the
south
eg
toulouse
marseille
of
france
aside
from
that
though
there
does
seem
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
homogeneity
compared
with
british
accents
for
example
oh
fun
thats
a
good
phenomenon
a
friend
of
mine
used
that
raising
to
look
at
accent
adaptation
in
comprehension
what
are
you
finding
specifically
please
post
your
question
to
the
qa
thread
at
the
top
of
the
subreddit
thanks
dont
you
get
that
im
not
talking
about
golds
theorem
that
there
are
other
results
in
computational
learning
theory
too
the
nowak
et
al
paper
discusses
this
i
dont
know
why
you
think
this
argument
rests
on
golds
theorem
its
just
a
more
formalised
version
of
the
problem
of
underdetermination
if
that
is
what
you
meant
then
we
have
never
disagreed
in
the
first
place
you
just
confused
me
by
stating
what
is
self
evident
as
some
kind
of
unique
revelation
you
said
you
objected
to
since
we
know
that
theres
no
learner
that
can
learn
an
entirely
unrestricted
set
ie
theres
no
learner
that
exists
that
could
learn
english
and
walpiri
and
every
other
natural
language
and
not
be
restricted
since
you
apparently
do
believe
that
theres
restrictions
that
define
a
class
of
natural
languages
even
if
theyre
impoverished
but
its
just
haggling
at
this
point
you
conceded
everything
important
then
formal
universals
exist
as
it
is
now
you
would
have
to
explain
why
those
restrictions
exist
it
is
selfevident
which
is
why
i
dont
know
why
you
denied
it
in
the
first
place
formal
universals
exist
thats
what
generative
grammar
studies
and
not
having
them
means
you
have
no
way
of
describing
why
natural
languages
arent
like
a
completely
different
logically
possible
set
of
unlearnable
languages
its
actually
quite
straightforward
its
the
human
language
ability
thats
what
ug
is
thats
like
saying
that
gravity
is
the
tendency
of
things
to
fall
down
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
spaces
or
anything
its
about
word
units
morphemes
etc
nothing
to
do
with
orthography
at
all
of
course
it
does
if
they
used
different
romanization
for
japanese
the
sentences
would
be
different
even
different
romance
langauges
differ
slightly
in
where
they
write
spaces
its
mentioned
in
the
article
that
its
too
hard
to
get
data
for
man
because
is
used
so
much
in
other
contexts
i
am
also
from
texas
and
most
of
my
male
friends
and
some
of
my
female
friends
use
dude
or
man
some
of
these
people
might
use
bro
too
but
definitely
less
frequently
than
the
aforementioned
and
probably
because
they
started
using
bro
jokingly
only
to
accidentally
adopt
it
fwiw
i
am
29
what
no
man
or
boy
got
it
yeah
she
did
have
a
2004
ijal
paper
specifically
on
semantic
fieldwork
methodology
not
to
mention
a
forthcoming
coauthored
chapter
in
her
coedited
book
on
semantic
fieldwork
methodology
but
the
one
that
haspelmath
was
responding
to
was
davis
et
al
not
matthewson
et
al
and
not
just
on
semantic
methodology
so
i
imagine
you
might
not
have
been
the
only
one
who
might
have
had
difficulty
following
along
why
do
english
and
french
tend
to
drop
vowels
at
the
ends
of
words
and
names
italia
italy
ariana
arianne
ugo
hugh
etc
this
is
totally
ungrammatical
to
me
as
a
native
speaker
of
american
english
first
the
adjective
gone
refers
to
a
state
of
being
unlocatable
so
semantically
its
incompatible
with
an
adverb
like
quickly
and
actually
im
having
a
hard
time
coming
up
with
any
adjective
that
could
go
with
quickly
in
a
sentence
where
be
is
the
mainrather
than
auxiliary
verb
secondly
the
placement
of
quickly
is
not
right
it
could
literally
go
anywhere
else
in
that
sentence
except
between
the
and
fox
and
be
wellformed
syntactically
i
didnt
claim
heredity
was
selfevident
im
saying
the
statement
of
its
subject
matter
is
not
circular
logic
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
your
replies
to
me
on
this
subject
make
you
sound
like
a
buggy
chat
box
who
just
picks
on
keywords
of
my
comments
and
spouts
some
vaguely
related
antichomskiansounding
nonsequitur
i
dont
know
what
you
think
youre
getting
from
interpreting
everything
i
say
into
a
context
where
i
did
not
apply
it
and
where
it
naturally
breaks
apart
but
youre
certainly
not
making
a
good
impression
of
yourself
what
gives
you
the
impression
that
r
is
more
common
have
you
read
an
article
that
suggests
this
i
think
you
would
really
enjoy
an
introductory
linguistics
andor
phonetics
class
well
if
im
using

there
is
no
gr
outside
the
theory
called
gr
in
physics
scientists
are
concerned
about
if
theories
are
valid
not
why
im
not
sure
why
youre
saying
this
because
its
not
true
scientists
arent
considered
with
validity
but
soundness
of
theories
if
validity
was
the
only
concern
then
there
would
be
no
need
to
select
between
theories
that
are
equally
valid
and
have
better
or
less
theoretical
coverage
but
this
is
quite
simply
just
ahistorical
scientists
are
concerned
with
what
best
explains
a
phenomenon
not
just
whether
its
a
valid
description
agreeing
that
a
phenomena
is
true
but
disagreeing
over
the
theory
that
explains
it
is
not
outside
the
realm
of
science
thats
just
standard
scientific
practice
my
point
is
why
cant
the
number
of
theories
be
reduced
the
primary
objective
should
be
to
elliminate
most
of
them
if
there
are
so
many
why
is
that
not
being
done
it
is
being
done
im
not
sure
what
youre
objection
is
here
its
standard
practice
in
the
sciences
for
there
to
be
competing
theories
which
are
reduced
as
further
research
is
done
this
is
just
the
same
for
all
fields
i
did
what
you
quoted
was
the
system
of
principles
and
structures
that
are
the
prerequisites
for
acquisition
of
language
and
to
which
every
language
necessarily
conforms
but
thats
just
saying
that
theres
a
language
ability
theres
no
claim
about
it
being
domainspecific
or
domaingeneral
apes
kittens
and
rocks
dont
acquire
language
ergo
theres
a
system
of
principles
and
structures
that
allows
humans
to
acquire
language
you
may
disagree
over
what
these
principles
and
structures
are
but
you
cant
deny
that
such
a
system
exists
my
position
is
that
innate
grammar
is
not
necessary
i
presume
you
mean
grammar
in
terms
of
specific
linguistic
information
again
the
point
is
that
ug
as
a
term
doesnt
require
that
i
dont
think
you
can
account
for
a
wide
array
of
linguistic
phenomena
without
it
but
this
isnt
a
position
counter
to
the
term
ug
there
is
a
need
for
a
vocal
tract
exceptional
hearing
and
audio
processing
and
likely
some
kind
of
abstract
reasoning
and
the
ability
to
understand
analogies
there
is
however
no
need
for
anything
that
artificially
limits
the
kind
of
language
we
can
learn
and
use
the
first
sentence
is
either
a
contradiction
with
the
last
or
youre
just
completely
wrong
but
let
me
get
this
straight
are
you
claiming
that
there
is
absolutely
no
limitation
on
what
languages
we
can
have
and
that
language
can
differ
endlessly
hi
all
i
was
wondering
if
someone
could
possibly
explain
the
um
ending
not
sure
if
i
can
call
it
a
suffix
in
many
latin
words
further
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
so
many
english
words
ending
in
um
are
almost
always
latin
in
origin
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
read
this
i
should
have
made
it
more
clear
the
type
of
conjugation
i
was
talking
about
the
word
can
mean
different
things
does
mandarin
have
inflectional
conjugation
eg
with
affixes
like
many
ie
language
do
or
is
it
totally
isolating
even
in
verb
conjugation
well
its
a
balance
of
two
opposing
forces
isnt
it
all
instances
of
use
of
a
word
present
an
opportunity
for
noveltychange
to
be
introduced
and
highfrequency
words
are
therefore
the
most
subject
to
this
force
however
if
they
were
constantly
changing
it
would
be
an
impediment
to
meaning
conveyance
so
theres
an
opposing
force
of
resistance
to
change
i
mean
this
is
not
my
subfield
so
i
could
be
way
off
but
thats
the
way
i
understand
it
well
this
suggests
a
lexical
diffusion
model
of
change
as
the
primary
vehicle
for
changes
in
a
language
and
thats
not
really
right
at
least
not
for
phonological
and
morphological
change
changes
tend
to
affect
all
instances
of
a
given
phoneme
or
natural
class
in
a
certain
environment
so
its
less
the
instance
of
a
word
coming
up
as
the
phoneme
so
we
wouldnt
expect
high
frequency
words
to
be
any
more
or
less
susceptible
to
change
however
since
they
are
so
frequent
there
is
greater
evidence
to
get
their
form
down
so
they
tend
to
resist
change
better
than
infrequent
forms
this
is
even
truer
in
morphology
where
regularization
has
far
more
exceptions
which
is
why
we
hear
about
exceptionless
sound
change
more
than
exceptionless
morphological
change
prolly
too
lazy
to
look
im
browsing
reddit
and
drinking
a
beer
ive
officially
given
up
for
the
evening
just
really
addressing
your
tldr
here
its
not
that
linguists
view
the
concept
of
language
standardization
as
detrimental
but
its
generally
the
view
of
linguists
that
having
bad
attitudes
towards
people
who
do
not
utilize
the
standard
form
at
all
times
calling
them
stupid
uneducated
deficient
in
some
way
or
calling
the
dialects
of
lower
socioeconomic
groups
nonlanguages
corruptions
or
laziness
is
what
is
detrimental
and
yes
you
are
correct
prescriptive
rules
fall
outside
the
subject
of
linguistics
as
for
rbadlinguistics
its
generally
just
a
fun
place
where
we
make
fun
of
socalled
grammar
nazis
occasionally
though
you
do
see
us
discuss
unscientific
views
of
language
that
are
popularly
discussed
on
reddit
and
around
the
web
im
a
little
lost
about
what
exactly
a
nonconfigurational
language
is
in
typology
could
someone
walk
me
through
exactly
what
that
means
and
how
it
contrasts
with
its
logical
opposite
the
configurational
language
whatever
that
is
as
well
i
keep
stumbling
on
these
terms
while
reading
articles
about
wakashan
and
salishian
languages
theres
a
large
crossover
but
computational
linguistics
is
more
ambiguous
between
computational
modellingcomputational
implementations
of
linguistics
i
think
perhaps
the
term
mathematical
linguistics
is
less
widely
used
these
days
but
theres
still
journals
out
there
and
people
publishing
in
that
area
though
it
seems
more
towards
the
theoretical
computer
science
side
of
things
mathematical
linguistics
is
definitely
a
thing
the
classic
book
is
partee
ter
meulen
and
walls
mathematical
methods
in
linguistics
a
few
more
current
ones
are
kornais
mathematical
linguistics
keenan
and
mosss
mathematical
structures
in
language
tomalins
linguistics
and
the
formal
sciences
theres
also
things
like
millers
strong
generative
capacity
computational
learning
theorylearnability
theory
is
closely
related
and
heres
a
good
paper
by
heinz
on
computatipnal
phonology
he
also
has
a
really
interesting
paper
with
idsardi
on
complexity
differences
between
different
parts
of
language
heres
a
recent
paper
by
clark
and
shaloppin
which
i
guess
are
most
associated
with
computational
linguistics
greg
kobeles
work
would
be
of
interest
too
i
suspect
theres
more
out
there
but
theyve
slipped
my
mind
some
good
things
to
search
for
would
be
modeltheoretic
syntax
edward
stablertype
minimalist
grammars
transderivational
constraints
joshis
work
on
tree
adjoining
grammar
and
complexity
of
languages
too
would
be
important
categorical
grammars
as
well
theres
at
least
another
semirecent
book
out
about
there
but
unfortunately
ive
forgotten
its
name
im
afraid
that
this
is
a
side
area
of
interest
and
i
lack
the
mathematical
maturity
to
really
grasp
a
lot
of
it
as
much
as
i
can
if
i
thinkremember
of
anything
else
ill
let
you
know
because
it
implies
the
current
and
much
shorter
castilian
occupation
is
somehow
more
natural
and
native
to
the
indigenous
peoples
of
the
iberian
peninsula
there
arent
really
any
documentaries
out
there
but
i
found
a
video
thats
comparing
persian
i
know
its
not
exactly
the
same
thing
with
german
and
english
came
in
to
mention
ryuukyuuan
a
much
better
analogy
i
would
say
than
kanto
and
kansai
kanto
and
kansai
is
more
like
british
and
american
english
classical
chinese
liturgical
languages
eg
nonspoken
liturgical
forms
of
sanskrit
quranic
arabic
these
are
languages
that
are
neither
the
result
of
nor
subject
to
the
natural
changes
that
the
socalled
natural
languages
undergo
in
some
cases
such
as
classical
chinese
theres
some
intentional
opacity
to
the
language
here
is
one
what
did
the
stage
look
like
where
speculuespejo
had
a
j
you
dont
say
physicists
discovering
what
linguists
have
known
for
years
i
wonder
if
theres
a
linguistics
journal
that
would
publish
my
work
on
velocity
i
dont
but
i
appreciate
the
gesture
ive
heard
this
in
southern
finland
from
finns
that
speak
swedish
as
their
first
language
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
catch
on
that
it
meant
yes
ah
whoops
youre
right
i
cant
believe
im
forgetting
my
phonetics
already
its
only
been
a
year
smland
is
a
region
my
host
mom
in
paris
used
to
do
the
exact
same
thing
she
was
older
in
her
60s
link
for
the
lazy
um
ill
look
up
all
the
words
you
used
and
try
to
make
sense
of
them
meanwhile
thanks
for
taking
the
time
there
are
also
sound
changes
that
create
these
consonants
as
well
as
vowel
shifts
that
put
them
in
positions
where
theyre
susceptible
to
later
weakening
something
similar
to
the
english
epenthesis
of
nsnts
so
prince
and
prints
are
homophones
could
occur
that
creates
a
stop
and
raising
of
a
low
vowel
could
create
i
in
a
hypothetical
language
with
the
hypothetical
word
onaxe
you
could
have
something
like
onaxaonxonxeoxeukxeukeuki
and
so
on
even
more
simply
we
could
have
deletion
be
the
culprit
you
could
have
the
hypothetical
word
kain
lose
the
first
vowel
and
become
kin
or
you
can
have
fortition
which
is
completely
unconditional
in
some
types
of
irish
english
the
weak
dental
fricatives
and
have
become
the
strong
plosives
t
and
d
it
could
happen
with
xk
as
well
languages
need
contrasting
sounds
to
be
intelligible
if
every
sound
became
too
similar
there
would
be
no
way
to
figure
out
what
words
are
being
spoken
it
might
be
that
the
general
trend
is
toward
weakening
but
that
would
also
mean
that
the
general
trend
is
toward
deletion
and
every
word
would
be
phonemeless
i
think
a
good
comparison
would
be
a
geological
one
even
though
mountains
are
eroding
across
the
planet
they
are
also
being
built
up
at
the
same
time
its
just
that
we
tend
not
to
recognize
the
buildup
when
we
see
it
while
erosion
is
obvious
in
things
like
rivers
and
rockslides
so
while
sounds
are
constantly
eroding
in
language
theyre
being
built
up
through
other
processes
like
fortition
epenthesis
vowel
breaking
vowel
lengthening
and
compounding
well
just
because
words
are
difficult
impossible
to
define
crosslinguistically
doesnt
mean
that
theyre
necessarily
a
useless
concept
for
the
analysis
of
any
particular
language
sometimes
various
kinds
of
grammatical
tests
coincide
in
really
nice
ways
and
give
us
the
appearance
of
some
kind
of
unit
that
looks
a
lot
like
a
word
should
we
ignore
those
consonant
harmony
welsh
is
also
a
more
lively
minority
language
than
irish
scots
also
puts
a
significant
dent
in
it
its
not
entirely
due
to
immigrants
there
are
four
languages
native
to
britain
other
than
english
as
a
comp
ling
person
with
a
background
in
cs
i
would
recommend
starting
with
python
or
possibly
matlab
if
youre
after
specific
linguisticsrelated
features
theres
a
good
python
library
called
natural
language
toolkit
available
this
will
depend
very
much
on
how
you
define
best
of
course
is
it
better
to
encode
superfluous
information
eg
mark
plurality
on
both
the
noun
and
verb
as
is
often
the
case
in
english
or
is
it
better
for
there
to
be
no
redundant
information
one
is
more
efficient
in
terms
of
information
transfer
the
other
might
be
better
in
some
practical
contexts
and
so
on
incidentally
if
you
wanted
to
consider
just
the
most
efficient
way
to
encode
audio
information
the
best
language
would
theoretically
sound
like
white
noise
dixon
speculates
to
the
same
effect
in
his
1984
memoir
ok
thanks
haha
yep
its
not
controversial
within
certain
circles
but
i
think
its
not
the
general
view
of
things
i
think
thats
perhaps
because
im
more
interested
in
the
language
ability
as
an
insight
in
the
cognitive
structure
of
the
mind
rather
than
language
considered
traditionally
as
a
medium
of
communication
are
you
really
this
rude
i
dont
want
anyone
reading
this
thread
to
come
away
with
the
mistaken
impression
that
your
response
to
the
question
was
actually
ontopic
and
that
linguists
believe
that
prescriptive
language
ideologies
arent
a
valid
field
of
study
if
that
makes
me
square
then
okay
yes
i
am
whatevs
putting
my
moderator
hat
on
for
a
moment
though
dont
be
a
dick
on
this
sub
the
insult
you
used
this
time
is
pleasantly
quaint
and
toothless
so
no
official
action
will
be
taken
now
but
consider
this
your
warning
about
remaining
civil
i
am
particularly
fond
of
the
argument
that
l1
interference
is
more
of
a
fallback
for
when
the
l2
is
not
completely
learned
therefore
an
l2
learner
without
a
specific
feature
in
their
l1
cant
use
the
feature
because
they
havent
learnt
it
thoroughly
or
otherwise
yet
i
will
reiterate
ukeyilans
argument
here
that
theres
a
rather
lot
of
social
pressure
for
the
l1
speaker
to
use
the
language
in
a
certain
way
but
if
a
l2
speaker
doesnt
most
people
wont
exert
the
same
amount
of
pressure
on
the
l2
speaker
to
conform
so
they
may
not
acquire
their
l2
as
completely
as
their
l1
ive
been
using
liberation
fonts
in
my
xelatex
documents
ive
had
no
problems
with
boldingitalicizing
ipa
symbols
so
far
does
anyone
know
of
any
already
existing
written
spoken
video
sources
of
him
speaking
to
this
question
or
similar
not
so
much
a
question
about
linguistics
as
it
is
about
rlinguistics
does
this
sub
have
a
recommended
reading
list
like
raskhistorians
does
if
so
where
is
it
and
can
it
be
made
more
visible
on
the
sidebar
if
not
can
we
get
one
in
my
introductory
linguistics
classes
and
in
an
esl
class
im
taking
were
using
the
book
language
files
i
found
it
super
helpful
for
laying
out
and
describing
each
type
of
sound
and
understanding
how
theyre
classified
and
produced
theres
also
a
lot
of
examples
and
sections
to
practice
transcribing
what
youve
learned
if
i
remember
correctly
and
for
a
slightly
more
in
depth
look
into
the
sounds
and
the
theory
behind
their
study
and
understanding
i
liked
introducing
phonology
from
cambridge
we
used
this
in
my
phonology
class
and
it
was
a
great
intro
to
that
field
hope
this
helps
bjrk
is
a
good
one
should
rhyme
with
jerk
pronounced
properly
also
one
of
those
ones
where
people
insist
on
miscorrecting
you
well
it
sort
of
does
in
some
circumstances
but
we
dont
have
a
vowel
associated
with
it
so
its
hard
to
teach
yeah
kalaallisut
alias
west
greenlandic
inuit
has
a
bunch
of
what
sadock
2003
calls
derivational
clitics
so
like
you
can
have
illumiipputit
illumiikvutit
houselocsbeind2s
where
you
have
the
noun
illu
inflected
for
locative
case
but
then
gets
subsequent
morphology
creating
a
new
verbal
stem
i
dunno
if
this
is
quite
what
youre
looking
for
if
it
is
i
can
talk
a
bit
more
about
them
though
i
taught
dutch
to
frenchspeaking
adults
over
the
summer
i
had
one
student
who
would
substitute
german
where
he
didnt
know
the
dutch
word
but
very
rarely
use
his
first
language
french
i
suspect
he
did
this
because
german
and
dutch
are
closely
related
though
whereas
german
and
spanish
are
totally
different
languages
maybe
you
are
subconsciously
avoiding
english
and
filling
in
with
the
next
best
thing
you
might
be
on
to
something
but
im
a
little
hesitant
simply
because
there
are
plenty
of
words
in
the
third
declension
that
reflect
core
physical
concepts
flesh
child
but
it
may
be
related
to
why
some
of
those
same
words
in
the
modern
language
fossilized
in
one
particular
declension
form
and
changed
genders
in
the
process
cf
masc
singular
nominative
was
masc
accusative
now
feminine
nominativeaccusative
or
same
as
was
masculine
dative
now
neuter
nominativeaccusative
or
as
if
people
use
um
more
as
they
get
younger
what
about
chinese
orthography
i
feel
like
they
should
be
at
a
serious
cognitive
disadvantage
compared
to
those
who
need
to
learn
english
dont
get
me
wrong
thought
english
orthography
is
terrible
especially
for
the
type
of
writing
system
its
only
a
step
down
from
chinese
english
has
many
similar
borrowings
from
arabic
eg
alcohol
admiral
arsenal
alchemy
algebra
etc
i
guess
you
meant
borrowings
in
english
from
languages
other
than
arabic
got
to
ask
about
bust
and
burst
in
british
english
a
company
that
becomes
bankrupt
goes
bust
and
a
police
raid
is
a
bust
but
you
would
burst
a
tire
or
a
balloon
does
british
english
take
bust
from
rural
america
or
does
it
come
from
elsewhere
fair
enough
i
knew
it
was
an
oversimplification
when
i
wrote
it
and
i
shouldnt
have
included
it
thanks
for
the
explanation
of
the
first
one
but
the
second
one
seems
to
be
rush
explaining
how
it
would
seem
strange
that
ignominy
should
ever
have
been
adopted
as
a
milder
punishment
than
death
but
i
dont
understand
what
it
means
to
say
did
we
not
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
question
would
fit
after
that
comma
or
that
the
period
is
an
accident
melcherts
conditioning
due
to
frequency
is
the
citation
for
that
his
1974
paper
exceptions
to
exceptionless
sound
laws
edit
pdf
interesting
could
you
explain
what
makes
this
artificial
in
a
way
that
separates
other
organic
construction
transfers
edit
i
misread
it
looks
like
youre
saying
that
l1
persian
speakers
must
have
picked
up
urdu
as
an
l2
and
gotten
the
ball
rolling
that
way
as
they
sprinkled
their
urdu
with
persian
constructions
maybe
theres
something
to
that
its
worth
noting
that
ghalib
himself
spoke
urdu
as
his
first
language
but
of
course
that
means
little
if
this
construction
were
already
common
in
urdu
by
his
time
are
there
any
examples
of
an
organic
addition
you
could
point
me
to
it
seems
to
me
like
the
artificial
case
l2
speakers
speaking
breaking
the
language
would
be
the
norm
rather
than
the
exception
is
leiden
university
the
netherlands
wellknown
for
its
linguistics
program
im
curious
to
whether
any
of
you
have
actually
heard
of
this
university
and
if
it
gets
any
worldwide
attention
equivalent
consubstantial
thanks
for
the
tip
that
will
be
very
useful
for
me
in
the
future
im
sure
strange
that
basque
and
georgian
arent
in
the
alignment
sections
sample
set
98a
though
considering
they
are
the
two
most
spoken
ergativeabsolutive
languages
yeah
thats
a
good
point
rather
than
saying
that
mostall
languages
have
some
sort
of
valency
changing
i
should
have
said
that
mostall
languages
have
some
way
to
focus
or
defocus
arguments
of
a
verb
in
zarma
it
looks
like
using
the
third
person
singular
pronoun
has
the
effect
of
defocusing
the
agent
while
not
technically
changing
the
valency
of
the
verb
i
know
that
songhay
and
related
languages
have
some
weird
voice
behavior
too
some
claim
it
has
an
antipassive
voice
so
maybe
theres
another
construction
that
does
something
similar
yes
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
learning
a
language
as
an
adult
is
nearly
as
difficult
comparatively
as
people
tend
to
think
it
is
first
of
all
kids
brains
have
more
plasticity
and
havent
lost
the
ability
to
hearreproduce
new
tonal
sounds
and
phonemes
adults
have
to
most
speakers
of
japanese
an
r
and
an
l
sound
almost
exactly
the
same
just
like
to
my
ear
the
japanese
words
for
bridge
and
chopstick
hashi
and
hashi
sound
the
same
but
young
children
can
and
usually
will
be
able
to
distinguish
those
sounds
even
in
a
foreign
language
but
thats
about
it
my
son
has
been
immersed
in
the
english
language
since
the
day
he
was
born
almost
three
years
ago
he
still
has
issues
with
verb
tenses
and
irregular
verbs
and
has
a
very
limited
vocabulary
and
its
more
than
just
learning
from
birth
if
you
study
english
as
a
second
language
youll
learn
that
kids
entering
the
school
system
not
speaking
english
generally
take
five
to
seven
years
to
gain
a
level
of
proficiency
equal
to
their
peers
five
to
seven
years
adults
who
complain
they
cannot
learn
a
foreign
language
are
not
spending
six
hours
a
day
180
days
a
year
for
five
to
seven
years
plus
extracurriculars
the
grocery
store
tv
and
basically
a
completely
immersive
experience
outside
of
the
home
practicing
a
second
language
if
they
did
theyd
have
fluency
guaranteed
but
they
might
still
an
accent
and
thats
okay
native
german
all
sentences
you
wrote
sound
wrong
der
wille
etwas
zu
machen
haben
sie
denn
keinen
freien
willen
how
come
in
european
languages
the
words
for
no
are
all
reasonably
similar
no
nien
non
nie
but
the
words
for
yes
seem
to
be
rather
different
yes
jarh
oui
tak
si
i
appreciate
language
families
have
similarities
yesjarh
and
ouisi
but
these
seperate
families
all
have
very
different
words
for
yes
whereas
they
all
have
similar
words
for
no
no
but
you
need
phonetics
to
have
a
greater
phonological
system
phonetics
which
both
of
those
papers
discuss
and
youd
see
that
if
you
even
bothered
to
read
the
first
page
and
a
half
of
the
first
pdf
i
linked
sign
languages
have
phonetics
even
the
intro
text
book
i
have
admits
it
they
just
go
into
0
detail
about
it
im
colorblind
it
looks
purple
and
green
im
trying
to
think
of
any
examples
of
monosyllabicised
words
which
might
be
candidates
for
such
a
cluster
but
im
not
coming
up
with
any
anythings
possible
but
i
dont
see
anything
that
might
currently
be
headed
in
that
direction
i
was
one
of
the
people
who
said
that
to
the
op
note
that
we
all
agreed
that
phonology
covered
both
signed
and
spoken
so
we
were
only
talking
about
phonetics
no
one
is
doubt
that
the
computation
is
simalar
if
not
identical
between
the
two
but
the
etics
is
about
the
machine
there
has
never
been
a
phonetics
book
that
mentionned
the
eye
and
hands
and
nature
of
light
there
is
just
no
overlap
in
the
subject
matter
so
naturally
and
obviously
it
is
a
different
field
and
of
course
no
one
is
arguing
that
is
an
analog
to
phonetics
precisely
discussing
the
physiology
of
hands
arms
facial
movements
sight
light
and
so
on
but
as
i
said
there
is
no
overlap
this
is
exactly
what
ive
been
looking
for
thank
you
so
much
youre
definitely
using
the
terminology
in
a
differentand
much
narrowerway
than
im
used
to
it
being
used
within
the
field
youre
ruling
out
a
significant
portion
of
what
i
do
what
the
phoneticians
in
my
department
do
and
what
is
published
in
journals
like
the
journal
of
phonetics
phonetica
journal
of
the
acoustical
society
of
america
and
so
on
to
be
clear
im
pretty
sure
you
understand
this
but
others
might
not
thy
is
second
person
singular
uicehouse24ozcan
is
saying
that
thy
language
all
together
is
there
third
person
we
say
does
your
language
use
not
do
your
language
use
theres
also
been
some
debate
in
the
mixed
race
asian
community
about
the
word
hapa
which
is
hawaiian
in
origin
originally
it
refered
to
someone
who
is
half
hawaiian
and
half
some
other
race
but
people
of
halfasian
descent
particularly
on
the
west
coast
and
hawaii
have
adopted
it
to
describe
themselves
as
well
and
some
hawaiians
see
this
as
another
more
dominant
group
englishspeakers
in
this
case
appropriating
their
culture
and
identity
im
torn
between
wanting
to
respect
that
and
recognizing
that
languages
are
constantly
borrowing
terms
and
broadening
or
narrowing
definitions
as
they
change
i
had
been
meaning
to
start
a
similar
thread
here
in
the
past
to
gauge
thoughts
about
linguistic
appropriation
but
never
got
around
to
it
thanks
for
starting
one
thank
you
very
much
for
the
advice
great
detail
thanks
this
would
create
a
nonphonemic
distinction
why
if
its
more
retroflex
and
speakers
hear
the
difference
thank
you
the
symbol
while
usually
a
rhotic
in
most
languages
represents
the
d
and
t
sounds
when
between
vowels
in
your
dialect
probably
so
when
you
quickly
say
butter
do
you
notice
how
theres
a
d
like
sound
made
by
tt
thats
called
an
alveolar
tapflap
it
means
youre
pronouncing
it
like
a
d
but
quickly
slapping
your
tongue
against
the
place
of
articulation
so
when
you
see
the
examples
listed
with
its
not
referring
to
the
sound
made
by
r
but
by
t
and
d
butter
b
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
actually
thank
you
okay
now
what
perspective
are
you
interested
in
an
applied
field
cognitive
issues
ethnography
of
communication
textual
analysis
your
question
is
very
broad
youll
get
more
helpful
responses
if
you
narrow
it
down
a
bit
if
youre
interested
in
linguistic
theory
youre
going
to
want
to
start
with
some
research
on
discourse
issues
in
either
role
and
reference
grammar
or
the
minimalist
program
im
not
sure
how
much
has
been
done
on
discourse
issues
in
the
latter
though
im
sure
theres
something
since
there
have
been
transformation
perspectives
on
discourse
but
its
fully
integrated
into
the
former
for
the
minimalist
program
youre
going
to
want
to
go
into
it
with
a
background
in
xbar
theory
she
says
that
the
source
is
a
medical
glossary
which
are
generally
different
than
translation
dictionaries
glossaries
often
provide
short
descriptions
of
terms
while
translation
dictionaries
provide
the
best
equivalent
words
the
writing
in
that
passage
is
a
little
confusing
because
she
calls
it
a
hmong
translation
but
it
has
to
be
a
hmong
description
it
is
probably
the
case
that
the
author
of
the
glossary
couldnt
or
didnt
provide
a
hmong
equivalent
to
chromosome
because
there
isnt
really
a
good
one
that
would
be
widely
recognized
by
patients
were
talking
about
a
group
of
people
who
are
largely
agricultural
and
rural
and
on
top
of
that
marginalized
can
bulgarian
gagauz
be
saved
maybe
moldavian
gagauz
be
helpful
i
have
never
heard
of
the
nonword
reading
span
the
reading
span
is
standard
you
can
google
around
for
sentences
the
original
task
is
due
to
daneman
and
carpenter
1980
you
might
start
with
danemans
email
she
is
at
a
univ
toronto
campus
some
people
prefer
the
operations
span
a
variant
proposed
by
engle
his
lab
makes
available
eprime
versions
but
to
run
them
you
need
eprime
which
is
horribly
expensive
you
might
email
his
lab
manager
and
see
if
hell
send
you
just
the
sentence
stimuli
another
possibility
is
to
fallback
to
a
shortterm
memory
test
stm
is
not
as
predictive
of
anything
as
wm
so
this
is
less
than
ideal
still
people
have
made
arguments
that
backwards
digit
span
is
not
an
awful
proxy
you
can
find
stimuli
for
this
by
googling
around
good
luck
i
disagree
with
half
the
stuff
in
the
article
poetry
his
dialect
has
a
definite
southern
twang
but
its
not
strong
so
probably
on
the
edge
of
the
south
like
east
texas
or
northcentral
florida
or
north
kentucky
that
i
dont
know
is
that
something
you
can
do
im
afraid
i
dont
speak
german
being
good
at
puzzles
and
being
articulate
also
help
that
is
just
because
you
understand
the
modern
language
does
not
mean
youll
understand
the
older
version
other
skills
are
needed
in
my
opinion
i
have
to
be
honest
all
those
graphics
and
weird
color
effects
just
made
it
difficult
to
follow
maybe
dial
that
back
a
bit
a
number
of
underdocumented
languages
have
only
recently
gotten
an
orthography
and
these
are
now
often
being
used
to
write
stories
and
things
in
addition
to
bible
translations
its
not
appropriategrammatical
when
talking
about
a
particular
person
this
is
sam
they
are
a
teacher
would
most
likely
be
perceived
as
incorrect
this
is
something
thats
changed
for
me
within
the
last
few
years
i
used
to
find
it
odd
but
now
its
unremarkable
and
i
use
it
myself
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
in
a
few
decades
its
the
norm
in
colloquial
speech
my
copy
actually
arrived
in
the
mail
later
that
day
i
posted
this
in
my
historical
linguistics
class
the
professor
asked
our
intuition
about
the
use
and
context
of
the
different
pairs
and
our
opinions
of
it
greatly
varied
for
me
specifically
i
would
tend
to
use
the
ed
past
for
normal
conversation
but
t
past
for
formal
writing
it
seems
like
a
fairly
straightforward
instance
of
fortition
maybe
passing
through
a
fricative
phase
i
think
this
is
in
large
part
due
to
growing
up
with
many
other
spanishspeakers
as
their
peers
because
theyre
living
in
an
immigrant
enclave
if
they
grew
up
in
white
suburbia
instead
they
would
typically
have
none
no
matter
how
their
parents
spoke
well
atleast
i
learned
something
new
the
best
part
of
being
wrong
my
children
have
been
raised
in
ireland
and
i
am
from
massachusetts
in
this
case
they
have
no
need
to
code
switch
as
i
am
the
only
american
they
speak
to
regularly
and
they
cannot
imitate
my
accent
any
better
than
i
can
imitate
theirs
which
is
badly
since
my
language
isnt
represented
ill
give
it
a
shot
what
two
languages
do
you
speak
im
fluent
in
mongolian
and
english
could
you
tell
me
something
about
how
you
learned
each
of
them
im
a
mongolian
and
the
language
is
my
mother
tongue
however
my
family
lived
in
an
englishspeaking
country
for
a
number
of
years
when
i
was
very
young
and
i
started
school
there
after
coming
back
i
enrolled
in
an
english
language
school
and
kept
improving
what
language
do
you
think
in
it
depends
mostly
i
dont
really
notice
if
im
doing
something
in
mongolian
i
guess
i
think
in
mongolian
and
the
same
is
true
of
english
is
one
of
your
languages
dominant
for
writingreading
english
is
dominant
due
to
the
fact
that
almost
all
entertainment
media
and
professional
materials
i
consume
is
english
but
for
speaking
mongolian
is
dominant
but
as
englishs
vocabulary
is
much
more
diverse
using
a
mishmash
of
both
languages
is
usually
convenient
for
a
variety
of
situations
but
only
if
the
other
person
im
talking
to
is
reasonably
competent
in
english
that
said
i
sometimes
feel
that
i
express
emotions
etc
much
better
when
speaking
in
english
what
language
do
you
dream
in
does
it
alternate
i
dont
really
remember
my
dreams
and
the
only
dreams
i
specifically
remember
that
involved
me
speaking
were
pretty
bizarre
in
one
dream
i
was
arguing
with
someone
in
hindi
despite
knowing
maybe
45
phrases
and
in
the
other
japanese
all
the
while
thinking
in
my
dream
that
my
japanese
has
gotten
pretty
bad
in
what
context
do
you
use
which
language
does
it
depend
on
where
you
are
who
you
are
with
at
home
or
at
work
i
freely
alternate
between
mongolian
and
english
with
a
few
people
including
my
brother
but
im
not
really
acquainted
with
many
people
who
are
completely
fluent
at
both
mongolia
doesnt
exactly
have
many
fluent
speakers
of
english
so
mongolian
is
dominant
at
work
has
being
bilingual
influenced
your
professional
life
do
you
use
your
bilingualism
at
work
yep
speaking
fluent
english
has
a
ton
of
advantages
how
did
you
acquire
your
languages
were
you
raised
bilingually
by
your
parents
did
you
go
to
an
international
school
i
learned
mongolian
at
home
and
english
at
school
first
abroad
then
at
home
i
didnt
go
to
an
international
school
but
as
i
mentioned
above
i
enrolled
in
an
english
language
school
with
many
foreign
kids
and
other
kids
like
me
who
recently
came
back
from
english
speaking
countries
we
used
to
speak
to
each
other
almost
exclusively
in
english
during
break
times
dowould
you
raise
your
children
bilingually
if
i
ever
do
have
kids
then
im
100
certain
to
do
just
that
maybe
even
trilingually
i
think
that
knowing
many
languages
aside
from
being
insanely
useful
gives
you
different
viewpoints
on
a
lot
of
issues
its
pretty
useful
do
you
prefer
one
language
over
the
other
not
really
in
an
all
mongolian
environment
i
wish
i
could
speak
english
to
everyone
but
when
im
abroad
i
begin
to
miss
speaking
mongolian
are
there
certain
words
or
things
that
are
easier
to
say
in
one
language
than
in
the
other
are
there
words
or
concepts
that
dont
have
an
adequate
equivalent
in
your
second
language
of
course
english
vocabulary
is
ridiculously
diverse
and
its
most
noticeable
when
doing
translation
work
which
i
do
on
a
freelance
basis
a
ton
of
english
terms
are
only
translatable
to
long
meandering
compound
words
in
mongolian
with
the
outcome
being
that
the
translated
text
invariable
becomes
much
longer
in
mongolian
especially
when
dealing
with
more
esoteric
stuff
for
example
the
term
biodiversity
translates
to
in
mongolian
almost
twice
as
long
one
reason
why
the
word
is
not
so
popular
is
that
its
aiming
to
replace
the
old
meaning
of
hen
meaning
where
in
a
vast
amount
of
dialects
didnt
know
that
was
an
argument
against
actually
but
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
youre
referring
to
the
word
hn
anyway
most
of
the
arguments
against
that
ive
heard
have
been
rather
petty
and
i
cant
really
see
why
so
many
people
have
such
strong
opinions
on
it
either
way
no
one
is
forcing
you
to
use
it
personally
my
biggest
gripe
with
it
is
that
while
it
can
replace
hon
and
han
theres
still
no
genderneutral
replacement
for
honom
and
henne
which
feels
inconsistent
i
know
thats
why
i
said
even
so
and
contrasted
it
with
regular
more
in
some
northern
dialects
theres
a
gender
neutral
pronoun
already
na
so
its
not
that
foreign
a
concept
in
those
areas
i
am
familiar
with
the
tendency
of
ancient
semitic
languages
to
lack
vowels
but
i
find
it
surprising
that
they
persist
to
the
present
day
how
in
the
world
could
that
not
be
problematic
so
more
and
more
im
sensing
that
youre
not
really
in
the
right
subreddit
this
is
a
sub
for
the
discussion
of
topics
relating
to
the
academic
field
of
linguistics
you
seem
to
be
much
more
interested
in
spouting
your
unfounded
beliefs
than
you
are
in
actually
learning
something
the
notion
of
grammatical
gender
has
been
discussed
extensively
here
and
if
youd
bothered
to
read
the
faq
or
do
a
quick
search
youd
already
know
that
calling
it
gender
or
feminine
has
nothing
to
do
with
biological
sex
and
is
rather
just
a
usual
naming
system
i
strongly
recommend
you
actually
read
some
of
the
comments
people
are
leaving
you
on
this
thread
its
amazing
the
whole
thing
hasnt
been
removed
already
i
found
an
interesting
scholarly
journal
article
that
is
highly
relevant
to
this
discussion
and
it
seems
to
vindicate
my
opinion
while
explaining
the
highly
charged
reaction
to
it
our
conclusion
is
that
a
wellintentioned
rejection
of
racial
superiority
motivated
the
doctrine
of
equal
complexity
and
that
it
was
important
to
linguists
for
culturalpolitical
reasons
to
maintain
this
doctrine
over
the
long
decades
in
which
racism
was
at
its
peak
in
both
europe
and
america
we
are
under
no
illusion
that
racism
has
now
disappeared
but
it
has
ceased
to
be
mainstream
the
result
has
been
that
a
younger
generation
of
linguists
experience
the
continued
force
of
the
doctrine
as
perpetrating
the
very
ideology
it
is
meant
to
contest
for
people
who
have
never
thought
in
racist
terms
the
doctrine
of
equal
complexity
of
languages
appears
antiscientific
an
arbitrary
refusal
to
countenance
the
development
of
possible
methods
to
measure
the
phenomenon
by
declaring
its
nonexistence
in
advance
why
the
downvotes
i
remember
having
read
explicitly
that
he
disliked
french
and
lotr
and
the
silmarillion
certainly
read
like
something
purposefully
written
in
anglish
he
wasnt
exactly
a
linguist
though
he
was
a
philologist
and
a
professor
of
anglosaxon
at
oxford
thank
you
for
the
advice
same
i
can
think
of
lots
of
times
when
ive
used
it
especially
after
reaching
some
kind
of
milestone
ex
i
can
drive
now
and
i
can
even
go
to
the
lake
to
feed
the
ducks
now
that
i
have
my
own
house
i
can
even
decorate
it
however
i
want
ah
youre
getting
married
you
can
even
use
all
of
that
crap
youve
been
pinning
on
pinterest
this
is
probably
a
better
question
for
rconlangs
i
dont
think
either
form
is
absent
on
either
side
of
the
ocean
one
just
happens
to
be
more
common
than
the
other
for
the
same
reasons
ny
other
last
name
is
more
or
less
common
in
any
community
or
in
other
words
its
not
a
countrybased
orthographic
change
they
are
just
two
last
names
spreading
on
their
own
that
happen
to
have
different
frequencies
in
different
countries
levesque
is
an
old
name
from
normandy
eventually
most
lvesques
updated
the
spelling
and
some
didnt
all
i
france
this
can
easily
happen
by
accident
when
an
illiterate
person
says
their
name
to
a
scribe
and
they
have
no
way
to
tell
whether
their
ancestor
used
a
different
one
other
spellings
include
are
attested
too
levek
lvque
lavesques
and
all
varitions
thereof
then
in
the
17th
century
some
lvesque
moved
to
canada
and
had
a
lot
of
descendants
i
was
taught
to
use
a
if
it
precedes
a
word
that
starts
with
a
consonant
sound
and
an
if
it
precedes
a
word
that
starts
with
a
vowel
sound
the
are
some
exceptions
to
this
rule
such
as
for
words
that
begin
with
a
long
u
sound
such
as
a
user
and
a
union
both
user
and
union
begin
with
j
a
consonant
sound
good
point
im
not
up
on
my
orthodox
history
but
the
bible
at
least
in
the
west
was
published
exclusively
well
copied
not
published
in
latin
for
a
significant
period
of
time
i
got
a
masters
in
linguistics
and
my
undergrad
was
history
with
a
minor
in
japanese
language
i
had
no
previous
experience
in
linguistics
and
i
was
fine
good
luck
i
have
already
seen
it
but
ill
watch
it
gain
so
i
wont
miss
anything
but
is
this
person
seriously
teaching
their
students
to
produce
glottal
stops
and
interdental
fronting
as
in
cockney
english
im
also
not
entirely
sure
on
the
intent
but
i
believe
that
the
writer
is
trying
to
convey
that
learning
about
the
wide
variety
of
dialects
and
accents
in
uk
ireland
is
beneficial
for
their
study
of
english
not
necessarily
to
replicate
them
but
so
they
have
the
opportunity
to
understand
any
speaker
of
english
we
actually
just
started
up
a
section
of
language
devoted
to
covering
historical
syntax
and
we
definitely
publish
papers
on
historical
linguistic
topics
in
language
as
well
in
fact
we
just
published
an
article
by
chang
et
al
on
the
origins
of
ie
which
received
a
fair
amount
of
general
discussionincluding
on
this
subreddit
iirc
we
dont
have
any
official
recommendations
for
journals
published
outside
the
lsa
but
speaking
as
a
former
linguist
i
understand
that
diachronica
and
jhl
are
pretty
wellregardedand
both
are
staffed
with
lsa
leaders
and
other
members
thanks
to
everyone
for
the
positive
responseand
for
all
the
great
questions
last
night
i
didnt
necessarily
intend
for
this
to
turn
into
an
ama
but
id
be
more
than
happy
to
do
one
if
people
want
to
talk
some
more
you
can
also
send
me
a
tweet
at
lingsocam
or
shoot
me
an
email
thanks
to
the
mods
for
the
topic
highlight
as
well
xposted
this
to
rslp
hope
thats
ok
awesome
little
game
going
to
have
my
students
play
it
in
my
languages
of
the
world
class
they
are
mostly
terrible
at
geography
and
languages
this
will
help
them
i
hope
thanks
can
you
explain
what
this
means
for
a
layman
this
is
my
favourite
response
and
the
first
ive
seen
sorted
by
top
comments
with
no
rebuttalcounterexamples
so
far
good
work
can
you
please
go
to
wwwvocaroocom
and
record
you
doing
this
tongue
twister
im
from
montana
and
will
probably
never
meet
a
swedish
person
or
be
able
to
encounter
this
rare
vowel
construct
via
a
native
speaker
id
love
to
hear
it
imho
the
debate
over
lack
of
recursion
is
somewhat
semantic
something
is
there
that
supports
multiple
clauses
chomskian
recursion
is
also
tied
intimately
with
teh
notion
of
deep
language
deep
language
is
hardwired
i
am
relatively
uninterested
in
the
encoding
of
language
as
hardware
or
software
as
well
what
i
feel
is
happening
is
some
sort
of
over
ride
of
what
can
only
be
considered
teh
natural
development
of
languages
it
is
probably
an
over
ride
rather
than
teh
one
in
thousand
absence
of
something
so
endemic
to
human
speech
i
see
similar
over
rides
in
zen
buddhist
koans
possible
so
there
is
more
precedence
for
a
presence
than
a
freak
occurrence
of
abscence
probably
scottish
gaelic
id
imagine
its
intermediate
between
irish
and
scottish
but
closer
to
scottish
from
what
ive
read
maybe
my
accent
is
a
hodgepodge
of
accents
i
definitely
adopt
words
cadence
and
tones
of
my
significant
others
yes
i
totally
agree
but
how
is
fk
really
less
vulgar
than
fuck
i
understand
the
analogy
with
the
toilette
that
is
logical
but
i
just
dont
see
fk
as
a
less
vulgar
word
compared
to
fuck
after
reading
the
same
censoring
for
so
many
years
i
and
probably
most
of
you
as
well
read
fk
as
fuck
when
we
see
it
restroom
is
able
to
stand
on
its
own
compared
to
fk
if
you
understand
linguisticks
is
weird
i
mean
they
sound
different
to
me
both
the
goat
and
flow
samples
the
first
sound
of
the
diphthong
is
more
fronted
in
the
british
version
the
scottish
sound
you
gave
is
certainly
farther
back
o
and
its
a
monophthong
which
i
think
sets
it
apart
more
clearly
id
say
the
us
dictionary
sound
you
gave
is
closer
to
than
o
but
its
still
farther
back
than
the
british
the
american
flow
sounds
like
to
me
i
dont
think
o
exists
in
my
dialect
southeastern
british
english
southern
brits
except
the
queen
distinguish
goat
and
gold
and
respectively
yeah
celtiberian
is
indisputably
celtic
in
fact
by
many
standards
its
probably
the
most
conservative
of
the
celtic
tongues
it
bears
remarkable
agreement
with
what
we
had
already
reconstructed
for
protoceltic
dont
know
how
it
is
in
the
states
but
in
construction
in
canada
lifts
typically
refer
to
limited
use
wheelchair
lifts
vs
elevators
because
at
the
moment
we
cannot
conduct
an
experiment
that
would
potentially
prove
it
to
be
false
it
seems
to
me
that
on
a
broader
scale
the
theoretical
rupture
youre
looking
at
is
between
an
emphasis
on
language
universals
and
one
on
language
diversity
most
folks
who
consider
their
primary
preoccupation
to
be
linguistics
full
stop
appear
to
follow
chomsky
in
emphasizing
the
former
to
them
the
name
of
the
game
is
to
isolate
the
universal
aspects
of
linguistic
syntax
from
the
culturally
determined
aspects
of
semantics
and
to
study
the
former
as
a
largely
selfcontained
system
with
the
dominance
of
this
type
of
generativecomputational
approach
in
linguistics
people
who
take
alternate
approaches
that
language
and
thought
are
codetermining
that
culture
plays
a
nontrivial
role
in
all
aspects
of
language
development
that
no
bright
clear
line
can
unproblematically
be
drawn
between
innate
biological
aspects
of
language
and
its
acquired
cultural
aspects
etc
usually
consider
their
principal
area
of
study
to
be
cognitive
developmental
or
cultural
psychology
or
even
linguistic
anthropology
or
philosophy
of
mind
rather
than
linguistics
per
se
sapirwhorf
and
lakoffjohnson
in
foundational
literature
and
more
active
modern
researchers
like
boroditsky
zwaan
tomasello
and
heath
would
probably
be
your
best
bet
among
folks
who
wouldnt
necessarily
look
at
you
funny
if
you
called
them
linguists
it
also
sounds
like
you
might
appreciate
spending
time
with
some
more
general
cogsci
literature
by
the
likes
of
vygotsky
piaget
and
maturanavarela
hungarian
has
a
distinction
between
two
types
of
red
piros
and
vrs
that
doesnt
exist
in
any
other
language
im
familiar
with
what
to
an
extent
most
indoaryan
languages
including
gujarati
and
even
the
dravidian
languages
barring
tamil
save
for
its
brahmin
registers
exhibit
some
sort
of
diglossia
between
a
sanskritized
high
register
and
a
more
colloquial
low
register
neologisms
and
technical
vocabulary
are
typically
coined
or
calqued
using
sanskrit
and
borrowed
as
tatsama
same
as
that
vocabulary
but
tadbhava
born
from
that
vocabulary
is
more
common
in
everyday
usage
compared
to
other
indian
languages
modern
standard
hindi
is
unique
in
that
it
is
pitted
against
the
heavily
persianized
urdu
so
the
high
register
is
very
consciously
extrasanskritized
with
the
standardization
of
prestige
dialects
of
various
indian
languages
in
the
18th
and
19th
centuries
saw
the
increased
usage
of
sanskrit
loans
in
the
written
and
educated
spoken
language
even
displacing
native
words
with
sanskrit
loanwords
so
theres
more
of
a
continuum
between
low
and
high
registers
on
the
other
hand
high
hindi
can
be
quite
artificial
because
it
is
the
result
of
conscious
effort
to
rid
the
language
of
urdu
the
only
way
to
ensure
all
of
the
discussions
here
are
interesting
to
everybody
is
to
not
allow
discussion
at
all
or
in
other
wordsif
it
bothers
you
that
much
then
yes
you
shouldnt
be
here
but
there
will
other
discussions
about
other
things
that
you
might
find
interesting
constituents
very
frequently
have
constituents
within
them
does
anyone
have
a
link
to
a
version
of
this
with
english
or
spanish
subtitles
alguien
tiene
una
versin
de
eso
con
subttulos

o

theres
a
difference
between
telling
someone
this
is
probably
confirmation
bias
and
telling
them
this
is
how
you
can
check
to
see
if
this
is
confirmation
bias
or
not
the
first
one
implies
that
its
implausible
that
theres
a
real
pattern
which
isnt
exactly
blatant
misinformation
but
also
isnt
ideal
people
are
having
a
kneejerk
reaction
to
the
idea
based
on
i
dont
know
what
but
i
think
it
might
be
that
they
sense
the
possibility
of
linguistic
stereotypingbias
also
you
cant
see
the
responses
that
have
been
removed
also
note
that
the
op
actually
asks
about
literature
on
the
topic
and
software
to
confirm
that
this
is
a
real
pattern
this
post
wasnt
written
to
convince
anyone
but
to
learn
more
since
no
one
else
has
done
so
let
me
throw
in
my
intuition
in
favor
of
the
ditransitive
all
of
the
ditransitive
preach
examples
you
gave
are
grammatical
to
my
ear
but
sound
distinctly
rural
to
me
however
the
original
example
with
from
seems
all
right
to
me
too
but
only
in
that
passive
construction
though
its
still
less
wellformed
than
by
anyway
do
you
object
to
counting
being
an
unbounded
process
all
the
infinitely
potential
sentences
out
there
are
just
that
potential
or
to
put
it
another
way
fairy
dust
until
they
are
instantiated
they
are
nothing
but
speakers
have
extremely
robust
intuitions
about
the
difference
between
some
of
these
never
before
uttered
sentences
which
are
judged
to
be
at
some
point
utterable
and
those
which
are
not
do
you
think
this
data
is
entirely
meaningless
just
fantasizing
about
fairy
dust
i
have
a
mundane
question
about
where
you
put
conference
papers
on
your
cv
ive
just
finished
a
paper
for
the
conference
proceedings
of
a
conference
i
presented
at
last
year
how
do
i
put
this
down
in
my
cv
do
i
put
it
in
the
list
of
publications
or
do
i
make
a
note
under
it
in
my
list
of
conference
presentations
saying
that
a
paper
was
written
and
published
in
the
proceedings
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
tones
have
a
semantic
function
in
tonal
languages
but
only
a
pragmatic
function
in
nontonal
languages
it
would
be
a
little
odd
in
a
tone
language
tones
have
the
same
function
as
phonological
features
like
voicing
the
difference
between
a
high
and
low
tone
on
a
syllable
is
like
the
difference
between
that
syllable
beginning
with
a
g
or
a
k
calling
it
a
semantic
function
would
be
vague
but
my
first
guess
would
be
that
you
mean
tones
have
semantic
meaningsbut
they
dont
any
more
than
voicing
does
also
you
cant
separate
pragmatic
and
semantic
functions
so
easily
also
also
tone
languages
can
use
tone
for
pragmatic
functions
too
yes
they
both
ultimately
come
form
latin
cnst
meaning
to
stand
together
or
steadfast
constant
constantine
as
informative
as
your
answer
is
it
fails
to
address
the
fundamental
corecorollary
of
the
question
posed
that
is
if
theres
any
evidence
of
less
stuttering
amongst
those
whose
mother
tongue
is
tonal
well
thats
what
studying
is
for
and
honestly
learning
the
terminology
takes
a
while
ive
heard
both
dingus
and
bazoo
as
in
shut
your
big
bazoo
its
weird
that
firefox
cant
render
the
characters
but
now
when
im
on
alienblue
they
show
up
fine
then
say
at
some
point
people
start
dropping
off
the
final
consonants
thatd
leave
us
with
ax
and
a
with
the
previous
x
having
clearly
split
into
two
different
phonemes
do
you
mean
dropping
off
final
vowels
russia
is
not
a
single

noyau

voyeur

voyou
royal
etc
texas
actually
maybe
were
thinking
of
different
things
when
we
say
formal
but
the
way
i
see
it
yall
is
as
inherently
familiar
as
it
is
inherently
plural
there
maybe
times
when
its
used
in
formal
situations
but
that
doesnt
make
it
formal
it
just
introduces
a
familiar
element
into
a
formal
situation
to
fall
back
on
the
example
that
my
teacher
used
when
first
introducing
my
class
to
the
difference
between
tu
and
usted
in
spanish
if
i
were
called
to
testify
before
congress
i
would
not
call
them
yall
well
not
if
i
meant
to
be
completely
respectful
to
the
congresspeople
andor
the
institution
i
wouldnt
growing
up
in
china
i
can
definitely
confirm
it
more
means
central
than
middle
and
every
time
this
gets
brought
up
when
someone
says
middle
kingdom
there
is
someone
to
question
it
and
downvote
because
they
dont
understand
why
central
is
different
there
is
almost
a
sense
of
national
pride
when
people
pronounce
the
in
youll
notice
how
the
translation
only
mentions
center
in
noun
form
and
nothing
about
middle
to
give
an
example
of
why
this
is
different
consider
the
meaning
of
the
center
of
attention
and
the
middle
of
attention
se
bro
isnt
y
just
like
thatd
confuse
me
as
well
it
doesnt
upset
me
people
thinking
im
british
or
anything
i
just
find
it
odd
im
not
trying
to
say
there
are
only
those
three
but
they
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
shared
similarity
between
different
dialectsaccents
ive
seen
people
apply
it
to
each
of
the
states
individually
so
on
kinda
archetypes
of
sorts
i
dont
know
how
to
pin
it
down
but
as
a
curiosity
shrugs
it
may
be
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
so
both
nahuatl
and
navajo
are
fairly
well
described
in
fact
youve
picked
the
two
native
languages
of
the
north
american
continent
it
is
probably
easiest
to
find
learning
materials
for
for
navajo
you
will
want
to
check
out
the
salina
bookshelf
which
has
a
range
of
learning
materials
its
the
only
place
i
could
find
the
audio
media
to
go
with
textbooks
at
anything
other
than
an
insane
price
ivy
goossens
din
bizaad
is
fairly
good
theres
also
a
school
textbook
now
but
i
found
it
a
little
too
schoolish
one
problem
with
many
navajo
teaching
materials
is
that
they
simply
leave
out
or
save
for
last
the
3rd4th
person
difference
as
being
too
difficult
when
it
is
a
fairly
important
part
of
the
language
i
know
of
no
good
way
to
deal
with
this
there
are
only
two
languages
on
this
whole
earth
that
make
me
cry
navajo
and
old
irish
in
both
cases
its
the
majestic
and
uncompromising
complexity
of
the
verbs
that
cause
most
of
the
agony
you
should
get
faltzs
the
navajo
verb
a
grammar
for
students
and
scholars
if
you
want
to
have
any
hope
of
correctly
conjugating
the
navajo
verb
for
nahuatl
its
a
bit
difficult
to
find
good
learning
materials
for
modern
varieties
which
arent
in
spanish
for
classical
nahuatl
there
is
a
lot
of
good
stuff
in
english
launey
and
mackays
an
introduction
to
classical
nahuatl
is
the
best
option
currently
but
be
on
the
lookout
for
inconsistencies
from
page
to
page
the
editing
on
this
was
a
bit
eccentric
in
places
and
some
fairly
obvious
errors
pop
from
time
to
time
ive
found
most
of
the
time
i
can
crosscheck
elsewhere
in
the
book
to
verify
the
book
uses
carochis
orthography
which
tries
to
catch
everything
going
on
in
the
language
but
isnt
going
to
be
seen
much
in
wild
texts
andrews
is
the
goto
guy
for
grammar
but
note
that
professionals
in
the
field
tend
to
prefer
the
earlier
edition
of
his
introduction
to
classical
nahuatl
in
the
most
recent
edition
the
analytical
apparatus
has
exploded
but
doesnt
really
bring
additional
enlightenment
nahuatl
as
written
lessons
in
older
written
nahuatl
can
be
tough
going
and
some
of
the
material
he
specializes
in
can
occasionally
be
a
bit
dry
but
its
still
worth
looking
at
and
going
through
it
stays
closer
to
the
orthography
of
wild
texts
well
i
guess
most
languages
have
words
that
sound
the
same
that
six
and
spruce
are
the
same
in
finnish
is
no
stranger
than
that
fur
and
fir
are
the
same
in
english
or
that
before
the
poll
the
poles
cleaned
the
poles
with
polish
polish
so
that
image
illustrates
a
good
case
of
finnish
homonyms
but
the
real
weirdness
of
finnish
case
usage
doesnt
show
up
at
all
rtranslator
and
rlanguagelearning
might
be
worth
a
shot
as
well
nope
reddits
not
that
flexible
unfortunately
for
me
haha
has
always
been
just
a
regular
old
laugh
and
hehe
is
more
of
a
sly
laugh
or
something
like
if
someone
told
a
dirty
joke
thatd
warrant
a
hehe
rather
than
a
haha
i
pronounce
hehe
like
hehheh
as
well
while
not
really
a
necessarily
inherent
reason
its
generally
considered
disdainful
because
adding
a
determiner
like
a
in
a
gay
or
the
in
the
gays
without
following
up
with
a
word
like
person
or
people
makes
the
adjective
into
the
central
being
of
the
person
over
any
other
trait
they
might
have
when
you
say
obama
is
black
youre
still
focusing
on
that
trait
but
youre
not
referring
to
him
as
that
trait
and
leave
the
implication
that
he
is
still
something
other
than
the
physical
manifestation
of
the
colour
black
itself
if
you
say
he
is
a
black
youre
not
putting
in
that
implication
that
he
is
other
things
as
well
almost
stating
explicitly
that
he
isnt
the
reason
thats
particularly
offensive
in
stigmatized
traits
like
race
or
sexual
preference
is
that
one
particular
descriptor
you
deprive
them
off
is
human
like
youre
saying
obama
is
a
black
not
a
human
the
stigmatization
reinforces
that
interpretation
as
certain
groups
are
similarly
dehumanized
so
people
may
assume
thats
what
youre
going
for
really
saying
that
more
research
is
needed
before
you
can
call
a
hypothesis
valid
is
a
refutation
you
need
more
evidence
is
a
lot
softer
refutation
than
heres
all
the
evidence
that
proves
you
wrong
but
its
still
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
proposal
japanese
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
sort
of
polar
opposite
linguistically
of
english
english
is
svo
japanese
is
sov
english
is
highly
analytical
japanese
is
agglutinative
and
inflected
english
uses
an
alphabet
japanese
uses
logograms
and
two
syllabaries
in
short
ive
always
found
japanese
similar
to
an
objectoriented
programming
language
and
seems
like
if
it
didnt
exist
as
a
natural
language
conlangers
would
invent
it
pick
something
you
have
a
genuine
interest
in
learning
learning
foreign
language
is
not
easy
especially
if
it
is
grammatically
dissimilar
from
your
own
as
you
may
be
aware
this
actually
is
one
hypothesis
for
a
goidelic
substrate
eg
discussed
here
it
totally
wrong
seems
like
a
strong
claim
mostly
unsupported
by
evidence
maybe
i
assessed
none
of
the
lexical
distances
myself
it
is
based
off
the
research
from
prof
konstantin
tishchenko
of
the
kyiv
taras
shevchenko
university
i
tried
figuring
out
exactly
what
methodology
he
used
but
could
not
my
ukrainian
is
not
that
good
sadly
one
of
my
guilty
pleasures
is
masochism
regarding
internet
comments
edit
since
at
least
one
person
didnt
like
my
comment
ignorant
comments
like
those
in
that
thread
my
biggest
drive
in
the
field
of
linguistics
to
be
honest
they
drive
me
to
not
only
debunk
them
when
i
can
but
to
learn
more
and
educate
myself
so
that
i
have
more
evidence
to
debunk
more
ignorance
i
almost
think
as
long
as
the
comments
arent
stubbornly
offensive
and
clearly
not
trolls
its
even
worth
it
to
keep
the
ignorant
comments
just
as
an
example
for
others
maybe
thats
just
me
though
even
though
we
tend
to
think
of
language
learning
by
children
as
l1
acquisition
this
is
not
strictly
always
true
i
have
taken
french
classes
from
the
time
i
was
four
years
old
to
the
time
i
was
in
my
late
20s
but
i
was
raised
schooled
and
socialized
principally
in
english
the
whole
time
with
little
interaction
with
french
speakers
at
all
as
a
result
french
is
and
always
will
be
my
l2
there
are
studies
out
there
about
child
l2
acquisition
i
know
bonnie
schwartz
at
least
has
worked
on
this
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
want
to
compare
childrens
abilities
with
adults
it
is
this
type
of
comparison
that
we
should
be
undertaking
in
order
to
compare
like
with
like
alternatively
we
might
try
to
compare
latetolanguage
signers
with
signers
from
birth
to
compare
their
l1
acquisition
skills
as
well
in
any
case
asking
if
infants
and
children
are
better
at
learning
language
is
only
a
coherent
question
if
we
stick
to
the
same
type
of
language
learning
mx
is
progressive
obviously
but
only
because
everybody
knows
progressives
would
like
it
its
not
defined
with
reference
to
anything
outside
the
imaginations
of
people
so
it
is
not
even
remotely
objective
ive
not
heard
it
but
its
quite
possible
that
this
is
hypercorrection
a
lot
like
the
use
of
whom
in
more
contexts
than
it
was
traiditionally
used
i
never
said
that
they
share
any
kind
of
ancestor
or
origin
language
all
i
said
was
that
they
are
related
and
usingborrowing
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
words
from
another
language
makes
them
related
it
was
just
another
meaning
of
the
word
related
i
was
using
but
sure
downvote
me
for
contributing
nothing
wrong
edit
and
the
fact
that
the
english
language
is
using
the
latin
alphabet
is
a
relation
too
in
the
south
of
zeeland
it
is
also
pim
pam
poentje
its
just
that
there
arent
any
good
metrics
of
organization
of
cognition
and
i
think
most
linguists
would
consider
cognitivegainsthroughconlanging
as
a
pedagogical
technique
rather
than
as
having
any
implications
for
the
effects
native
languages
have
on
their
speakers
brains
i
dont
understand
what
youre
saying
sorry
i
agree
that
its
very
hard
to
measure
what
people
are
thinking
but
i
also
believe
that
there
are
some
very
real
principles
governing
the
processing
of
language
one
of
these
principles
is
the
one
that
i
was
discussing
here1that
any
synthesis
that
involves
anything
more
than
putting
two
adjacent
sounds
together
requires
cognition
to
compute
if
the
listener
is
to
think
about
the
way
in
which
the
two
components
synthesize
semantically
if
they
are
instead
heard
as
one
sound
the
listener
must
already
have
done
this
computation
in
the
past
and
look
up
the
result
of
that
computation
using
the
sound
of
the
fused
sememes
as
an
index

heavy

first
off
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
look
this
post
over
and
respond
secondly
to
answer
your
question
in
meaning
and
grammar
from
what
ive
read
chierchia
and
mcconnelginet
use
three
branches
in
logical
form
for
conjunctions
and
ditransitives
also
the
interpretation

again
thank
you
so
much
just
your
confirmation
that
im
moving
in
the
right
direction
is
inexpressibly
helpful
i
would
argue
that
it
is
an
adjective
and
functions
as
such
with
many
verbs
often
used
in
subjectverbcomplement
sentences
such
as
i
feel
well
im
not
well
you
look
well
although
i
can
certainly
see
it
takes
its
original
usage
from
the
adverb
form
i
think
it
has
become
an
adjective
in
its
own
right
why
do
you
add
n
at
the
ending
of
certain
words
in
esperanto
what
is
the
reason
for
this
rule
remember
that
aint
used
to
be
considered
correct
do
you
have
any
examples
of
formal
writing
in
the
past
that
uses
aint
rhyming
pairs
like
knowing
linguistics
i
wouldnt
be
at
all
surprised
if
there
was
a
more
obscure
term
for
it
but
im
pretty
sure
thats
all
ive
ever
heard
it
called
unless
you
mean
a
word
which
rhymes
within
itself
in
which
case
i
have
no
idea
ablaut
reduplication
for
future
reference
short
questions
that
just
need
a
single
term
as
a
response
are
better
suited
for
the
qa
thread
stickied
at
the
top
of
the
subreddit
does
anyone
understand
why
codeswitching
is
a
not
a
substandard
form
of
language
usage
hmm
i
didnt
know
bahais
had
glommed
on
to
esperanto
though
it
kind
of
makes
sense
katrina
hayward
experimental
phonetics
dont
know
if
it
contains
what
youre
looking
for
but
that
is
the
textbook
we
used
in
the
phonetics
class
this
semester
it
seemed
indepth
enough
but
i
havent
read
any
other
textbooks
dealing
with
formant
transitions
yet
but
id
still
recommend
checking
it
out
not
a
problem
i
have
trouble
understanding
jokes
at
times
too
and
sometimes
it
helps
to
deconstruct
them
a
bit
even
if
it
takes
away
from
the
inthemomentness
of
it
yeah
hoiluk
primarily
but
also
a
bit
of
siyen
out
of
necessity
i
just
thought
is
treated
as
an
allophone
of
before
i
this
is
my
sense
as
well
which
is
interesting
historically
since
it
wasnt
always
that
way
in
east
asia
literacy
is
definitively
relative
in
china
people
can
be
literate
and
still
not
know
uncommon
words
for
instance
sneeze
is
something
you
often
say
but
not
write
often
the
ability
to
at
least
approximate
the
spelling
of
any
word
one
knows
seems
an
absolute
advantage
of
alphabets
imo
i
dont
think
this
is
straightforward
codeswitching
for
true
codeswitching
you
need
to
be
actually
switching
between
two
grammatical
systems
above
comments
suggest
op
does
use
english
phonology
when
using
these
words
thats
some
evidence
of
codeswitching
but
other
speakers
are
nativizing
it
its
apparently
listed
in
the
macquarie
dictionary
as
a
nonstandard
variant

on

the

by

there
is

just
a

off

of
my
head
there
are
tons
with

this
guy
makes
really
interesting
videos
that
id
love
to
watch
but
i
just
find
him
annoying
anyone
else
i
think
hell
get
better
with
age
i
mean
experience
trumps
all
as
long
as
its
the
right
experience
as
an
example
we
were
just
hiring
a
new
copywriter
about
a
month
ago
and
most
of
the
candidates
we
interviewed
had
a
lot
of
the
wrong
experience
now
outside
of
the
job
i
think
all
experience
is
good
experience
because
you
learn
from
it
but
when
it
comes
to
being
a
good
fit
to
unlearn
a
lot
of
things
subjectiveintuitionbased
practices
into
learning
datadriven
experiencepractices
it
becomes
a
lot
harder
for
someone
to
be
a
good
fit
a
bad
experience
conversation
with
a
candidate
went
as
follows
candidate
we
produced
a
really
creative
video
for
product
and
it
got
over
11000
shares
on
facebook
us
thats
good
would
you
say
it
was
a
successful
campaign
candidate
well
yeah
it
got
a
lot
of
shares
and
we
won
the
gold
for
the
insert
advertising
award
name
here
us
thats
great
but
did
you
measure
anything
did
it
convert
where
did
you
send
them
after
the
video
what
kind
of
numbers
were
you
seeing
what
was
the
overall
growth
candidate
long
pause
i
dont
know
so
experience
depends
i
mean
after
writing
all
this
i
dont
want
to
delete
it
now
haha
everything
is
how
you
spin
it
sociology
and
creative
writing
are
fantastic
for
copywriting
especially
with
marketing
experience
the
only
way
to
really
find
out
is
to
write
spec
ads
the
thought
process
behind
why
the
ad
is
the
way
it
is
if
youre
looking
to
try
agency
and
for
inhouse
id
try
writing
a
lot
of
different
pieces
for
a
potential
company
landing
pages
banner
ads
email
copy
organic
articles
etc
to
show
them
what
you
can
contribute
itd
be
like
hey
i
love
the
stuff
you
guys
do
but
i
think
i
can
help
you
make
it
better
and
if
you
dont
know
what
you
want
to
do
do
anything
if
you
like
it
great
if
its
ok
youll
find
something
related
to
it
that
fits
you
better
if
you
hate
it
leave
the
job
with
experience
and
spin
it
toward
your
next
job
tldr
a
degree
means
shit
if
you
cant
spinapply
aspects
of
it
toward
what
you
want
to
do
and
if
you
dont
know
what
to
do
do
anything
because
youll
find
something
careers
arent
what
they
used
to
be
its
2
years
of
something
then
2
more
years
of
another
thing
and
so
on
and
its
fantastic
so
its
probably
more
like
trying
to
read
an
english
textbook
if
your
native
dialect
had
been
purged
of
a
lot
but
not
all
of
those
relevant
french
loanwords
ive
tried
that
before
and
the
end
result
really
is
quite
intimidating
back
to
korean
though
when
talking
to
north
koreans
ive
never
had
a
problem
besides
the
odd
word
so
the
two
types
of
korean
are
still
perfectly
intelligible
with
each
other
but
as
the
video
shows
a
textbook
or
a
bank
machine
is
really
quite
different
and
not
something
you
would
ever
want
to
misunderstand
myaamia
miamiillinois
although
its
referred
to
as
sleeping
rather
than
extinct
i
think
qualifies
for
the
sort
of
revitalization
youre
interested
in
to
my
knowledge
there
were
no
native
speakers
of
myaamia
only
historical
records
in
the
form
of
an
extensive
dictionary
and
grammar
recorded
in
the
18th
century
in
the
90s
the
miami
tribe
started
a
concentrated
revitalization
effort
and
have
had
some
real
success
at
bringing
the
language
back
to
life
there
are
other
languages
in
north
america
in
a
similar
situation
but
myaamia
struck
me
as
seeming
thoroughly
dead
before
it
was
brought
back
not
by
an
aging
generation
who
still
spoke
it
but
by
its
presence
in
the
historical
record
i
know
biblical
hebrew
very
well
the
vocabulary
is
sufficient
for
communication
yes
there
are
some
modern
concepts
that
you
might
not
know
but
chances
are
many
of
them
had
already
been
invented
and
discussed
for
just
one
example
the
mishnah
berurah
was
written
in
the
early
20th
century
it
deals
with
legal
jewish
law
halakha
and
specifically
discusses
the
interactions
with
the
law
and
the
technology
of
the
time
it
is
written
entirely
in
hebrew
any
period
of
jewish
history
has
many
similar
works
from
a
personal
example
i
know
biblical
hebrew
well
i
know
modern
hebrew
poorly
i
can
converse
with
a
modern
hebrew
speaker
without
any
significant
problem
i
may
say
things
that
are
a
bit
old
fashioned
but
its
perfectly
intelligible
as
far
as
i
am
aware
although
hebrew
ceased
to
be
used
as
an
l1
by
4
bc
modern
vocabulary
was
added
by
according
to
the
needs
of
the
clergy
in
discussing
contemporary
issues
it
was
also
kept
alive
for
literary
and
trade
purposes
im
trying
to
find
a
source
on
this
right
now
its
basically
just
one
of
many
fun
facts
you
pick
up
in
hebrew
schoolsummer
camp
edit
11
deals
with
this
topic
it
was
used
for
trade
there
is
evidence
of
butcherings
of
phrases
that
occurred
because
of
l2
hebrew
speakers
attempting
to
find
appropriate
vocabulary
for
their
dealings
i
found
this
paper
quite
interesting
skimmed
through
it
thanks
for
sharing
as
sort
of
a
converse
to
what
op
is
talking
about
as
a
nonnative
speaker
of
chinese
i
almost
always
use
and
never
which
i
had
to
look
up
to
double
check
just
now
has
it
ever
happened
that
the
language
identified
with
an
independent
country
has
been
voluntarily
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
i
cant
think
of
an
example
at
least
from
the
modern
era
but
the
population
or
number
of
people
speaking
french
is
low
the
number
of
people
speaking
french
is
actually
quite
high
its
only
low
when
you
count
native
speakers
exclusively
which
appears
to
be
what
this
graphic
does
wow
thanks
focusing
on
learning
to
speak
before
learning
to
write
is
a
good
idea
anyway
language
is
speech
after
all
not
ink
and
having
a
decent
handle
on
the
spoken
language
before
learning
characters
will
make
the
latter
a
much
easier
task
you
already
have
the
language
as
a
hook
on
which
to
hang
the
writing
system
thats
not
to
say
you
should
completely
avoid
the
writing
system
but
you
should
definitely
focus
more
on
speech
at
the
beginning
well
they
do
have
irish
gaelic
on
duolingo
that
should
give
most
people
a
good
foundation
they
teach
up
to
around
something
like
3rd
grade
level
i
think
and
then
you
can
use
that
to
further
your
knowledge
it
worked
for
me
and
portuguese
although
i
stopped
halfway
due
to
reasons
so
only
somewhat
and
if
you
genuinely
want
to
learn
the
language
youll
go
above
and
beyond
after
getting
the
fundamentals
derp
sorry
i
forgot
what
a
chain
shift
was
d
t
ts
i
assumed
you
were
saying
that
became
ts
which
is
obviously
nonsense
makes
a
lot
more
sense
now
as
a
side
note
i
would
argue
that
standard
german
also
retains
all
of
those
distinctions
it
just
has
fortis
k
instead
of
kx
and
actually
voiced
lenis
thanks
for
this
information
i
did
not
know
that
one
is
not
allowed
to
post
here
more
links
within
one
hour
maybe
i
misunderstood
the
purpose
of
the

its
not
about

not
allowed
the

not

a

just

exists
for
people
working
in
or
interested
in
the
academic
discipline
of
linguistics
to
converse
with
others
this
is
different
than
just
posting
links
to
youtube
we
do
have
people
who
post
links
to
their
blogs
or
videos
but
weve
spoken
to
each
and
every
one
of
them
directly
and
made
it
clear
that
were
really
only
okay
with
that
if
theyre
also
otherwise
interacting
with
the
community
every
person
whos
posting
their
blog
or
videos
is
only
doing
it
about
once
a
week
and
every
one
of
them
is
also
actively
engaged
in
conversations
in
the
subreddit
on
other
topics
that
other
people
start
i
am
sorry
but
i
dont
see
how
i
was
being
rude
when
you
said
i
dont
know
all
the
millions
of
links
that
were
posted
before
like
apparently
you
do
that
is
rude
the
above
mentioned
user
uses
words
like
bullshit
etc
and
i
am
rude
yes
they
said
bullshit
if
you
know
another
word
that
has
that
same
meaning
that
they
could
have
used
instead
then
im
open
to
suggestions
however
thats
a
commonly
used
word
in
english
and
is
not
really
taken
as
swearing
to
the
extent
that
other
words
are
feels
a
bit
like
the
airplane
scene
in
the
movie
anger
management
where
adam
sandler
allegedly
raises
his
voice
but
ok
i
wont
use
the
site
for
my
collection
of
interesting
links
as
apparently
reddit
is
something
for
trolls
and
bullies
duly
noted
seriously
okay
see
this
word
okay
now
look
to
the
right
thats
the
sidebar
thats
a
whole
bunch
of
clearly
posted
rules
meant
to
communicate
the
purpose
of
rlinguistics
to
people
who
are
new
in
addition
we
have
a
whole
other
page
of
rules
for
people
who
want
to
be
really
sure
this
isnt
all
of
reddit
this
is
rlinguistics
each
subreddit
can
and
does
have
its
own
rules
which
are
posted
in
the
sidebar
of
almost
every
one
this
is
an
academic
forum
that
just
happens
to
be
hosted
on
redditcom
its
for
academic
discussion
thats
clearly
posted
all
over
the
subreddit
if
you
want
to
call
us
trolls
because
we
dont
like
being
advertised
to
here
then
i
guess
were
trolls
and
i
dont
think
anything
udontpressctrlw
said
goes
against
the
fact
that
there
are
many
languages
without
grammatical
tense
why
is
the
khmer
word
for
language
phasa
when
thats
the
same
as
in
thai
and
lao
despite
khmer
being
unrelated
to
them
suppose
that
there
is
no
intended
bias
whatsoever
there
are
still
2
big
problems
i
can
think
of
1
unconscious
bias
is
real
and
systemic
merely
knowing
that
youre
testing
a
companys
product
and
that
theyre
providing
funding
for
you
can
push
you
toward
doing
things
different
from
how
you
would
without
that
funding
you
can
be
as
pure
as
you
want
theres
no
accounting
for
how
subtle
bias
affects
our
protocols
analysis
etc
2
merely
the
appearance
of
a
conflict
of
interest
can
reduce
the
credibility
of
your
work
even
with
disclosure
of
which
there
would
have
to
be
lots
other
researchers
are
inherently
skeptical
of
studies
funded
by
someone
with
a
vested
interest
in
the
outcome
because
vaginas
disagree
it
is
native
to
me
and
a
couple
people
i
know
maybe
we
are
just
freaks
p
lol
true
and
thank
you
but
i
rather
be
understood
without
feeling
selfconscious
imagine
spending
three
years
studying
four
words
thanks
for
participating
i
was
in
your
place
at
some
point
and
got
this
a
while
back
then
never
did
much
of
anything
with
it
because
im
a
lazy
bastard
but
it
looked
good
at
the
time
and
still
does
obviously
im
not
the
most
qualified
person
but
thats
a
starting
point
i
guess
independent
confirmation
that
it
does
happen
regarding
grapheme
color
synesthesia
i
wonder
how
much
it
depends
upon
letter
shape
versus
letter
sound
youve
confused
me
for
udontpressctrlw
who
appears
to
be
talking
of
a
canadian
dialect
while
i
am
a
random
british
guy
speaking
of
a
british
dialect
i
wonder
if
theres
a
relation
to
the
perception
of
a
week
so
that
begs
the
questionwhat
quantitatively
does
it
mean
that
vowels
are
more
or
less
distinct
no
that
is
most
definitely
not
what
ug
is
universal
grammar
is
the
set
of
formal
conditions
that
can
be
placed
on
language
rules
its
a
common
error
one
that
even
people
who
write
whole
books
on
the
matter
do
not
seem
to
grasp
but
along
with
much
much
of
what
this
presenter
says
this
part
of
the
discussion
simplifies
so
much
as
to
just
be
misleading
or
wrong
its
hard
to
tell
what
features
a
pidgin
lacks
that
shows
that
ug
does
not
constrain
its
development
is
this
guy
trying
to
claim
that
ug
isnt
in
effect
during
second
language
acquisition
if
so
he
should
explain
why
rebutting
prominent
researchers
on
ug
in
sla
like
rex
sprouse
bonnie
schwartz
lydia
white
and
laurent
dekydtspotter
who
have
done
extensive
research
on
the
matter
and
see
a
definite
place
for
ug
guiding
sla
other
things
that
this
person
gets
wrong
1
the
old
canard
of
creoles
coming
from
pidgins
yes
sometimes
that
happens
but
not
all
pidgins
yield
creoles
and
not
all
creoles
come
from
pidgins
this
idea
is
a
zombie
and
i
wish
i
knew
a
way
to
kill
it
but
i
suspect
it
will
just
live
on
2
the
idea
that
children
are
responsible
for
the
elaboration
and
stablization
of
a
creole
grammar
particularly
with
respect
to
tok
pisin
spoken
for
decades
by
adults
with
everincreasing
welldocumented
expansion
without
nativization
and
you
can
read
peter
mhlhuslers
pidgin
and
creole
textbook
for
more
on
it
this
claim
leaves
a
bitter
taste
in
my
mouth
do
kids
play
some
role
of
course
they
do
and
sometimes
its
significant
but
its
not
always
the
kids
leading
the
way
in
nativization
and
perhaps
even
not
usually
we
need
more
information
on
this
in
hawaiian
creole
for
instance
we
see
a
huge
influence
of
the
syntax
of
portuguese
whose
adult
speakers
were
the
first
to
shift
to
hawaiian
pidgin
as
their
main
language
with
their
kids
unsurprisingly
as
we
know
from
lots
of
studies
of
language
shift
and
from
sla
their
first
language
syntax
transferred
extensively
to
their
second
language
and
lo
and
behold
their
kids
picked
up
on
these
regularities
in
the
second
language
discourse
and
nativized
them
3
the
apparent
conflation
of
a
jargon
which
is
highly
unstable
with
a
pidgin
which
has
much
more
stability
4
the
idea
that
pidgins
and
creoles
are
common
results
of
people
coming
into
contact
who
dont
know
each
others
language
bilingualism
and
language
shift
are
far
more
common
and
the
video
doesnt
even
mention
that
its
subject
is
a
rare
rare
phenomenon
5
its
unclear
what
languages
of
the
caribbean
hes
referring
to
when
discussing
the
idea
of
caribbean
pidgins
perhaps
the
maroon
creoles
hopefully
not
the
creoles
of
places
like
belize
and
antigua
which
are
more
likely
to
have
emerged
in
africa
and
been
exported
to
the
caribbean
i
believe
john
holm
has
written
on
this
as
has
mervyn
alleyne
so
theres
a
lot
in
this
video
thats
misleading
and
it
shouldnt
be
taken
too
seriously
by
people
looking
to
actually
learn
about
pidgins
and
creoles
id
say
its
rather
doubtful
that
a
person
talking
about
the
scandinavians
is
talking
about
a
west
germanic
people
that
used
to
be
part
of
denmark
politically
250
years
ago
part
of
poland
was
historically
controlled
by
sweden
butyou
get
me
i
mustve
misinterpreted
your
post
sorry
about
that
used
to
babysit
for
french
kids
can
confirm
theres
also
un
biberon
which
gets
shortened
to
bibi
bottle
and
surely
a
ton
more
that
i
cant
think
of
right
now
what
typically
motives
the
development
of
tone
in
general
not
really
because
the
right
answer
is
very
context
dependent
i
dont
know
french
but
in
english
depending
on
who
you
are
and
where
youre
from
the
same
ipa
transcription
can
give
you
several
different
words
and
the
same
word
can
have
several
ipa
transcriptions
for
example
water
could
be
written
wt
if
youre
anunciating
very
carefully
or
it
could
be
w
or
w
or
w
a
trademark
of
philadelphian
english
or
in
the
other
direction
the
ipa
z
could
be
raise
rays
rase
raze
rehs
ris
res
or
possibly
race
you
cant
write
a
program
that
knows
the
difference
and
picks
the
right
one
for
helpful
tips
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
have
a
copy
of
the
ipa
table
maybe
keep
the
wikipedia
page
on
french
phonology
open
and
if
you
need
to
type
stuff
save
yourself
some
time
with
kappa
what
is
this
seems
the
bbc
used
to
do
surveys
reported
here
to
wank
is
to
masturbate
so
its
pretty
rude
yeah
same
use
in
french
but
not
sure
to
see
an
iranian
trend
abassides
arabians
seleukides
greeks
etc
does
though
have
a
counterpart
in
another
languagesystem
of
syntax
exactly
im
going
to
rules
homework
help
i
should
have
said
rnucleus
uh
i
dont
know
what
to
tell
you
other
than
it
is
an
acronym
how
is
that
not
a
reason
should
we
say
led
thats
just
too
much
work
facepalm
consider
that
a
brainfart
still
the
broad
sweep
of
my
comment
applies
at
least
i
think
you
should
make
a
new
post
asking
specifically
for
what
practical
uses
and
technologies
have
come
from
linguistics
as
a
field
historically
you
will
probably
get
better
results
since
this
one
is
centered
on
the
descriptionprescription
distinction
you
want
rlanguagelearning
how
was
the
aux
or
eux
irregular
plural
form
in
french
originally
pronounced
i
suppose
au
and
eu
were
diphtongs
but
the
x
something
like
an
x
or
voiced
thank
you
for
your
response
this
definitely
helps
me
understand
the
broader
goals
of
the
field
also
thanks
for
calling
people
out
re
downvotes
i
now
have
a
score
in
the
negative
for
this
sub
so
i
will
likely
have
to
use
an
alt
account
if
i
ever
want
to
post
in
rlinguistics
again
this
is
all
sort
of
funny
to
me
because
everyone
here
seemed
to
assume
i
was
some
outsider
who
just
wanted
to
attack
the
field
when
im
actually
studying
linguistics
myself
i
was
just
having
trouble
articulating
how
linguistics
is
useful
and
so
i
wanted
to
be
prepared
when
i
inevitably
am
posed
that
question
the
answer
i
kept
trying
to
come
back
to
for
this
question
was
just
vague
knowledge
is
good
and
we
can
call
people
out
for
hate
speech
and
explain
why
it
is
harmful
but
i
knew
those
were
pretty
shitty
explanations
despite
the
downvotes
everyone
in
the
thread
was
very
helpful
in
their
responses
and
have
helped
me
improve
my
explanation
for
why
descriptive
linguistics
is
a
force
for
good
in
the
world
it
indeed
seems
to
be
the
case
there
are
probably
many
overlapping
reasons
and
this
doesnt
go
all
the
way
back
to
medieval
spanish
but
i
wonder
if
the
rae
had
some
temporary
influence
the
real
academia
espaola
was
founded
in
1713
modeled
after
the
italian
accademia
della
crusca
1582
and
the
french
acadmie
franise
1635
with
the
purpose
to
fix
the
voices
and
vocabularies
of
the
castilian
language
with
propriety
elegance
and
purity
its
aristocratic
founder
juan
manuel
fernndez
pacheco
marquis
of
villena
and
duke
of
escalona
described
its
aims
as
to
assure
that
spanish
speakers
will
always
be
able
to
read
cervantes
by
exercising
a
progressive
uptodate
maintenance
of
the
formal
language
no
ergativity
is
usually
explained
as
intransitive
clauses
being
the
same
and
the
cases
in
transitive
clauses
switched
around
im
saying
its
much
simpler
to
look
at
it
from
the
other
side
with
transitive
clauses
being
the
same
as
in
nominative
accusative
languages
only
that
the
other
of
the
two
cases
is
used
in
intransitive
clauses
in
dutch
fronzen
although
no
can
really
predict
the
future
i
found
this
to
be
a
quite
entertaining
read
and
somehow
related
to
your
question
reminds
me
of
what
do
was
romani
already
a
separate
language
within
india
though
ah
yuchi
we
meet
again
there
still
are
people
referring
to
themselves
as
alemannen
theyre
the
germans
of
switzerland
are
the
only
nonfranconian
germans
bordering
in
italy
and
france
and
speak
dialects
called
alemannic
i
cannot
take
any
more
pictures
right
this
moment
because
it
is
a
reference
book
and
im
no
longer
at
the
library
but
i
can
definitely
give
you
more
context
the
topic
is
not
the
japanese
language
but
instead
it
is
the
amami
island
languages
see
the
book
title
is
study
of
the
fundamental
vocabulary
of
amami
dialect
and
the
author
is
hirayama
teruo
it
was
published
in
1986
ill
try
to
get
some
more
pictures
of
relevant
pages
soon
if
that
would
help
i
am
keen
to
make
use
of
this
book
as
much
as
possible
so
frisian
is
closer
to
english
than
dutch
that
has
not
been
true
for
centuries
the
dutch
influence
has
been
so
strong
its
now
hard
to
distinguish
from
a
dutch
dialect
i
meant
in
terms
of
origins
i
wouldnt
have
referenced
branches
of
west
germanic
like
that
otherwise
i
think
this
is
why
they
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
being
used
for
bound
variables
where
does
the
feminine
form
come
from
in
italian
in
sentences
like
inutile
portarla
per
le
lunghe
lho
scampata
bella
questa
volta
in
both
sentences
it
is
feminine
yup
adele
goldbergs
course
and
it
is
indeed
on
construction
grammar
sorry
for
the
confusion
like
i
said
i
honestly
had
never
even
heard
of
this
until
this
morning
thank
you
for
clearing
this
up
for
me
1
thanks
i
failed
to
discern
this
bigger
picture
but
how
does
4
do
that
exact
same
thing
as
well
4
contrasts
with
what
has
been
mentioned
but
4
may
introduce
new
material
in
which
case
4
does
not
highlight
a
certain
thing
as
being
removed
from
a
salient
set
you
mean
l
before
consonants
right
i
think
its
also
not
entirely
known
how
elision
worked
and
when
it
was
used
i
have
always
spelled
it
coperate
and
renter
how
common
is
this
in
spanish
when
you
read
a
word
you
know
exactly
how
its
pronounced
so
it
must
be
marked
in
some
way
do
you
a
lot
of
my
spanishspeaking
friends
drop
all
accents
when
they
type
and
theyre
understood
just
fine
for
example
donde
estas
wey
me
dejaste
solo
seems
to
be
just
as
readable
as
dnde
ests
gy
me
dejaste
solo
i
wouldnt
hold
your
breath
for
old
legacy
systems
to
be
updated
your
bank
probably
has
no
plans
to
update
their
cobol
before
they
need
to
fix
it
for
the
y10k
bug
but
most
modern
software
you
use
today
should
support
utf
just
fine
jason
cenoz
is
a
leader
in
this
field
as
i
recall
but
thanks
for
this
i
remember
anecdotally
that
a
german
professor
i
had
who
knew
that
i
was
proficient
in
french
who
was
surprised
at
the
relative
lack
of
interference
of
french
phonology
in
my
german
and
the
difficulties
i
had
separating
my
french
and
spanish
early
on
so
when
i
found
the
l3
stuff
it
confirmed
my
anecdotal
experience
and
i
remembered
it
now
to
make
it
into
a
buzzfeed
article
and
then
weve
come
full
loop
i
think
this
might
be
better
1
who
did
you
consider
whether
to
kill
2
who
did
you
consider
whether
james
killed
1
is
much
better
imo
sure
i
would
like
the
acceptability
judgments
of
linguists
oh
i
had
no
idea
i
used
google
scholar
so
i
thought
it
would
be
at
least
credible
my
english
teacher
uses
long
a
to
refer
to
an
a
and
regular
a
to
refer
to
it
irks
me
a
little
ill
be
honest
this
isnt
relevant
to
the
overall
point
the
vast
majority
of
those
papers
are
well
read
and
discussed
by
many
generativists
but
note
that
the
evans
of

isnt
the
same
evans
thank
you
i
will
be
visiting
the
library
to
see
if
the
book
is
available
could
you
recommend
a
similar
crash
course
for
linguistic
terminology
and
the
offchance
that
neither
are
available
at
the
library
are
there
any
similar
resources
available
online
thanks
again
turtle
which
i
believe
is
a
clipping
of
handietalkie
an
older
word
possibly
a
brand
name
for
walkietalkie
you
might
want
to
get
rl
trasks
a
students
dictionary
of
linguistics
that
should
help
you
out
a
fair
bit
also
have
you
checked
with
the
instructor
about
whether
linguistics
terminology
will
be
covered
whether
theres
a
glossary
etc
ps
are
you
bajan
by
any
chance
i
frequently
cite
a
prominent
creolist
whose
name
is
so
close
to
mine
that
when
i
cite
a
work
of
his
that
came
out
in
the
same
year
as
a
work
of
mine
i
have
to
cite
myself
using
my
first
and
middle
initial
to
distinguish
us
i
have
yet
to
meet
him
but
im
looking
forward
to
it
when
it
happens
a
friend
of
mine
from
grad
school
had
a
name
so
common
that
there
was
another
person
in
her
subfield
working
on
problems
of
the
same
nature
who
had
the
same
first
and
last
name
though
my
friend
ended
up
changing
hers
when
married
in
large
part
because
of
how
indistinct
her
birth
name
was
youre
right
but
its
multiple
people
so
im
wondering
if
theres
a
particular
reason
vietnamese
but
vietnamese
separates
every
syllable
with
a
space
this
is
a
great
question
for
our
qa
thread
please
post
it
there
thanks
as
overprepared
as
i
can
be
within
a
month
im
basically
on
vacation
until
classes
start
so
i
have
lots
of
time
to
spend
on
it
embiggenning
i
always
thought
it
started
in
northern
england
u
wot
m8
rekt
m8
yknow
the
way
i
was
taught
is
for
a
phonetic
transcription
is
for
a
phonemic
transcription
is
for
spelling
example
fkn
fk
fucking
ianat
but
my
opinion
is
that
it
depends
on
context
if
you
were
translating
don
quixote
into
english
for
example
i
would
find
it
awkward
to
use
elizabethan
english
at
the
time
it
was
written
cervantess
spanish
was
contemporary
so
i
feel
that
it
betrays
the
intention
of
the
author
to
intentionally
use
archaic
language
now
lets
say
that
a
more
modern
author
was
writing
in
spanish
and
was
using
archaisms
if
a
modern
spanish
speaker
would
read
it
and
think
this
guys
talking
like
don
quixote
then
the
equivalent
would
be
to
make
it
sound
like
shakespeare
consider
also
asking
this
in
raskhistorians
please
answer
at
the
original
thread
not
here
aussie
brit
here
accents
vary
of
course
i
wonder
which
ucellwithoutculture
was
using
isnt
this
a
strategy
to
resolve
scope
ambiguity
in
cases
without
material
intervening
between
the
auxiliary
and
the
main
verb
t0
and
v0
theres
a
clear
ambiguity
that
can
only
be
resolved
with
prosody
i
can
not
eat
can
be
interpreted
with
the
negative
taking
scope
over
just
the
verb
i
have
the
ability
to
not
eat
or
all
of
tp
its
not
the
case
that
i
can
eat
but
with
intervening
material
like
been
now
we
have
two
positions
to
put
the
negative
to
resolve
the
ambiguity
i
have
not
been
eating
i
have
been
not
eating
the
scope
differences
give
somewhat
different
readings
here
the
second
seems
more
deliberate
doesnt
it
thats
nonsense
other
languages
have
accents
too
most
differences
between
accents
are
completely
regular
and
dont
cause
any
issues
in
reading
and
writing
lets
say
that
block
becomes
spelled
blokk
then
people
in
california
would
learn
that
o
represents
bostonians
that
it
represents
a
people
in
london
that
it
represents
and
so
on
but
everyone
would
spell
it
blokk
i
hope
i
used
the
right
vowels
but
you
get
the
idea
right
but
both
are
writing
systems
not
descendant
from
egyptian
hieroglyphs
the
sonority
scale
is
probably
a
good
place
to
start
yes
its
just
that
im
wondering
how
this
word
arrived
in
central
asia
as
the
common
word
for
man
cons
many
words
will
lose
etymological
associations
like
doubt
and
dubious
spelling
bees
wont
be
fun
anymore
these
are
all
issues
but
they
dont
strike
me
as
being
particularly
specific
to
chinese
or
to
machine
translation
they
deal
with
the
prerequisites
of
machine
translation
but
youd
run
into
problems
even
if
you
only
dealt
with
texts
in
pinyin
equally
pos
tagging
is
just
as
hard
for
english
as
it
is
for
mandarin
i
think
you
could
come
up
with
a
list
of
specific
mt
difficulties
for
any
pair
of
languages
complex
morphology
is
just
as
problematic
as
no
morphology
but
the
overall
level
of
difficulty
is
probably
the
same
it
seems
to
me
that
a
bigger
influence
will
be
the
amount
of
nlp
and
general
formal
treatment
of
a
language
here
english
will
trounce
any
language
but
i
suspect
chinese
has
much
less
depth
in
its
relevant
research
coverage
compared
to
many
smaller
european
languages
words
wont
lose
their
etymological
associations
they
will
still
have
come
from
the
same
roots
primarily
yeah
just
wanted
to
focus
on
it
rather
than
his
lastchapter
speculation
on
a
phoenicianinfluence
leading
to
grimms
law
and
some
sort
of
semitic
influence
explaining
the
strong
verbs
irregulars
in
english
he
also
has
a
whole
chapter
on
sapirwhorf
interesting
ive
worked
with
apertium
rbmt
system
and
francis
is
at
troms
too
right
now
so
thats
a
plus
im
not
sure
they
have
a
masters
program
though
but
ill
definitely
look
into
it
thank
you
for
the
response
tho
do
you
have
any
problems
with
etymological
associations
in
spoken
language
where
they
cant
be
distinguished
gotcha
i
was
thinking
of
a
silent
we
instead
of
passive
thank
you
to
both
the
difference
between
descriptivism
and
prescriptivism
is
probably
the
worst
thing
he
gets
wrong
he
gives
the
following
example
an
uthoritative
physics
text
presents
the
results
of
physicists
observations
and
physicists
theories
about
those
observations
if
a
physics
textbook
operated
on
descriptivist
principles
the
fact
that
some
americans
believe
that
electricity
flows
better
downhill
based
on
the
observed
fact
that
power
lines
tend
to
run
high
above
the
homes
they
serve
would
require
the
electricity
flows
better
downhill
theory
to
be
included
as
a
valid
theory
in
the
textbookjust
as
for
dr
fries
if
some
americans
use
infer
for
imply
the
use
becomes
an
ipso
facto
valid
part
of
the
language
this
is
of
course
precisely
backwards
it
is
the
prescriptivist
textbook
that
would
include
whatever
people
happened
to
believe
was
true
about
language
regardless
of
the
observed
facts
eg
that
there
is
a
steadfast
wall
between
infer
and
imply
while
the
descriptivist
textbook
would
note
what
we
actually
observe
which
is
that
such
a
wall
does
not
exist
i
mean
when
you
cant
even
keep
straight
the
implications
of
what
youre
talking
about
how
on
earth
do
you
expect
people
particularly
people
who
are
actually
better
informed
about
your
subject
matter
than
you
to
actually
respect
the
work
you
do
the
whole
essay
reeks
of
this
pseudointellectual
attempt
to
say
something
worth
listening
to
without
presenting
any
sort
of
reasonable
consistent
argument
ive
never
read
any
of
his
other
stuff
but
if
this
is
the
approach
he
takes
to
things
im
happy
to
stay
far
far
from
it
you
can
see
a
lot
of
other
critiques
of
this
piece
online
for
a
thorough
criticism
for
a
variety
of
posts
about
dfws
woes
and
fabricationsdistortions
accademia
della
crusca
is
the
italian
official
institution
that
has
he
power
to
rule
what
is
proper
italian
and
whats
not
or
not
yet
so
yes
there
are
people
in
italy
whose
job
is
being
a
grammar
nazi
a
me
mi
piace
its
amazing
to
me
how
even
after
their
separation
all
the
romance
languages
are
moving
toward
this
sort
of
doubling
just
at
a
different
pace
for
each
language
so
say
a
french
person
is
speaking
to
his
boss
would
heshe
omit
ne
or
is
ne
only
found
in
literature
at
this
point
as
for
standard
french
grvisse
just
mentions
that
it
happens
without
giving
any
rules
some
speakers
even
seem
to
accept
sentences
such
as
je
le
donne
elle
which
surprises
me
sorry
what
surprises
you
here
oh
no
problem
i
came
off
as
abrasive
sorry
that
makes
sense
i
wonder
why
everyone
says
jai
pas
instead
of
je
nai
pas
yup
swedes
are
crazy
about
this
some
people
call
radio
shows
just
to
alert
the
host
of
how
many
times
theyve
used
a
certain
colloquialism
during
the
program
or
complain
about
how
an
interviewee
pronounced
a
given
word
and
so
on
there
is
a
metric
fuckton
of
latin
from
such
a
vast
variety
of
sources
i
cant
even
begin
to
list
them
things
including
government
documents
poems
epics
propaganda
art
critique
speeches
philosophy
sciences
etc
just
google
for
something
like
cicero
to
find
his
poems
all
of
this
stuff
should
be
easily
findable
online
for
free
i
believe
that
oxford
or
cambridge
has
a
massive
collection
of
greeklatin
documents
for
free
through
their
database
oh
ok
gotcha
i
guess
i
was
defining
it
too
narrowly
i
was
thinking
of
english
more
in
terms
of
how
widely
it
is
studied
as
a
second
language
rather
than
being
natively
learned
alongside
a
variety
of
deferential
regional
languages
which
is
how
i
think
of
spanish
hindi
and
arabic
at
least
presentday
but
then
again
in
imperial
situations
that
isnt
really
the
case
thanks
for
setting
me
straight
on
that
one
day
perhaps
when
i
have
acquired
a
phd
in
assholery
i
shall
be
worthy
of
your
attention
and
merit
a
proper
response
hey
chill
out
there
was
no
chastisement
involved
umalignantmouses
reply
to
you
was
entirely
reasonable
and
didnt
at
all
warrant
your
response
well
their
distribution
is
different
in
english
adjectives
can
stack
big
red
striped
ball
but
determiners
cant
the
those
balls
that
this
ball
adjectives
in
many
languages
have
a
preferred
order
but
are
still
grammatical
in
other
orders
often
interpreted
with
a
focus
difference
the
big
red
ball
fthe
red
big
ball
but
the
same
isnt
true
for
determiners
big
the
red
ball
red
the
big
ball
in
english
adjectives
can
be
modified
with
intensifiers
like
very
very
red
very
big
but
not
very
the
theyre
also
semanticallytypetheoretically
different
adjectives
are
properties
describing
things
as
being
a
certain
way
things
that
are
red
things
that
are
big
and
we
can
model
them
as
sets
while
determiners
pick
out
things
though
they
can
restrict
which
things
they
pick
out
as
having
a
property
even
though
the
requires
a
single
individual
its
not
the
same
as
things
that
are
singular
i
better
not
have
just
done
your
homework
p
latin
never
died
as
such
it
gradually
transformed
into
a
bunch
of
different
languages
latin
is
welldocumented
so
if
somebody
wants
to
start
speaking
it
theres
less
of
a
barrier
moreover
classical
latin
has
been
dead
for
a
very
long
time
on
the
other
hand
yaghan
has
everything
pitted
against
it
its
harder
to
get
material
and
there
vanishingly
few
people
who
can
speak
it
never
mind
its
one
native
speaker
on
the
other
hand
its
not
yet
dead
thats
why
theres
more
value
in
revitalising
the
likes
of
yaghan
than
latin
latin
and
its
associated
cultures
are
already
wellpreserved
whereas
yaghan
and
other
languages
like
it
deserve
a
shot
at
at
least
a
fraction
of
the
cultural
preservation
that
the
likes
of
classical
latin
have
gotten
in
the
past
want
to
revitalize
it
make
a
video
game
implement
the
language
in
it
that
would
document
it
in
a
way
that
younger
people
can
associate
with
it
whats
inappropriate
about
it
indeed
its
called
tifinagh
but
arent
tamazight
riffit
tachelhit
and
atlas
tamazight
basically
different
languages
hmm
its
hard
to
draw
the
line
but
i
guess
a
riffian
wouldnt
understand
a
chelhi
and
so
on
but
still
there
is
a
common
root
for
these
languagesdialects
as
a
riffian
i
can
understand
and
recognise
some
words
from
the
other
dialects
and
the
standard
berber
but
most
sounds
like
gibberish
in
los
angeles
we
have
a
big
street
called
sepulveda
which
is
pronounced
sehpullvaduh
but
in
spanish
is
pronounced
sehpullveeduh
which
is
just
wrong
that
isnt
the
name
of
the
street
dont
listen
to
this
its
dumb
theres
another
street
called
rodeo
but
theres
two
of
them
one
is
in
beverly
hills
and
its
called
rowdayoh
and
then
theres
another
one
in
crenshawand
its
rowdeeoh
one
time
i
was
lost
in
crenshaw
on
a
bike
looking
for
rowdeeoh
so
i
asked
a
guy
which
way
it
was
its
necessary
at
this
part
of
the
story
to
mention
that
the
guy
was
black
and
that
im
white
and
while
there
was
no
malice
it
what
transpired
next
it
is
clearly
understood
that
white
people
seldom
go
around
crenshaw
which
is
a
black
neighborhood
he
says
to
me
are
you
sure
youre
not
looking
for
rowdayoh
and
we
shared
a
laugh
i
am
native
mexican
spanish
speaker
when
i
say
a
spanish
name
in
an
english
phrase
i
use
the
mexican
pronunciation
that
i
know
because
i
think
it
is
correct
as
long
as
it
is
understandable
and
it
is
a
way
to
share
my
language
and
culture
with
other
people
what
is
the
correct
way
to
pronounce
a
proper
name
anyway
why
would
the
english
version
of
a
name
be
any
better
than
the
native
version
if
theyre
both
understandable
and
pronounceable
im
not
a
german
speaker
but
i
think
what
they
are
referring
to
is
the
fact
that
verbs
often
occur
sentencefinally
in
german
so
having
a
longer
sentence
thus
builds
some
sort
of
tension
since
the
nature
of
the
event
structure
insofar
as
the
verb
is
crucial
for
it
is
unknown
until
the
last
word
of
the
sentence
i
try
to
avoid
paper
copies
because
international
shipping
costs
and
times
take
a
chunk
out
of
my
wallet
and
calendar
respectively
so
unless
im
going
home
to
the
us
for
some
reason
i
prefer
kindle
sure
but
yiddish
developed
in
the
middle
ages
from
german
and
not
from
proto
germanic
let
both
languages
branch
off
of
middle
high
german
if
you
want
interesting
indeed
fascinating
to
learn
of
the
depths
to
which
our
daily
interactions
subconsciously
dive
thank
you
for
sharing
a
couple
questions
1
do
other
monarchs
have
a
distinctive
speech
pattern
in
other
languages
as
well
2
for
defunct
monarchies
such
as
that
of
france
austria
germany
did
they
too
have
distinctive
speech
patterns
and
if
so
are
there
recordings
of
anyone
who
would
speak
today
in
the
same
way
as
the
defunct
monarchies
nonfiguratively
lets
see
em
make
an
intensifier
outta
that
im
fairly
sure
the
difference
is
between
violation
and
exploitationflouting
violation
of
a
maxim
would
go
something
like
this
a
im
out
of
petrol
b
theres
a
garage
around
the
corner
person
b
is
violating
the
maxim
of
being
relevant
they
are
only
observing
this
relevance
if
1
the
garage
is
likely
to
be
open
and
2
it
is
likely
to
be
serving
petrol
by
their
statement
they
are
implicating
both
a
maxim
is
flouted
at
the
level
of
what
is
being
said
but
assuming
is
it
observed
at
the
level
of
what
is
being
implicated
we
can
work
out
the
implicature
for
example
imagine
i
am
given
a
reference
from
a
former
tutor
for
a
job
application
the
tutor
has
written
she
has
great
handwriting
and
is
never
late
the
overt
exploitation
is
of
the
maxim
of
quantity
and
of
relevance
if
i
want
to
take
my
tutor
to
be
cooperative
i
have
to
assume
that
they
are
attempting
to
communicate
something
else
most
likely
that
i
am
a
bad
student
with
no
notable
qualities
so
im
pretty
sure
your
dr
cox
example
love
it
btw
would
be
an
example
of
the
latter
also
pretty
shitty
for
motivation
even
though
i
could
probably
get
quite
far
in
norwegian
as
a
native
german
speaker
i
just
dont
have
the
motivation
if
you
want
to
order
books
from
norway
its
30
delivery
to
germany
i
pay
10
delivery
from
amazoncojp
so
much
stuff
only
a
few
days
and
a
tenner
away
its
a
discourse
marker
or
stance
marker
which
means
it
is
used
by
the
speaker
to
communicate
her
level
of
emotional
investment
in
what
she
is
sayingresponding
to
do
people
really
pronounce
jalapeo
with
a
hard
j
sound
it
does
restrict
airflow
but
that
doesnt
mean
you
cant
hold
it
longer
the
air
pressure
simply
rises
to
a
higher
point
than
for
a
corresponding
short
plosive
edit
mhhhh
ok
i
had
a
lil
brainfart
there
no
airflow
is
required
for
holding
a
voiceless
plosive
plosive
length
gemination
is
actually
found
in
many
languages
eg
finnish
taka
back
vs
tak
fireplace
italian
fato
to
fate
vs
fatto
tto
fact
arabic
batl
hero
vs
battl
he

j
jk
hunt
vs

jk
jacket
the
contrast
is
often
conceptualised
as
the
germanic
fortis
vs
lenis
hence
the
phonemic
transcription
in
the
case
of
swedish
as
in
other
germanic
languages
long
consonants
follow
short
vowels
and
vice
versa
so
the
p
being
long
in
uppsala
is
connected
to
the
being
short
and
not
the
long
counterpart
id
always
read
that
as
highlighting
the
ed
ending
and
thus
mentally
pronounced
those
words
with
two
syllables
but
is
it
actually
the
opposite
did
the
apostrophe
indicate
that
the
word
should
be
pronounced
with
one
syllable
dont
know
any
details
about
the
actual
pronunciation
but
yeah
an
apostrophe
is
conventionally
used
to
indicate
missing
letters
as
can
be
found
in
english
contractions
like
cant
or
im
i
also
found
this
paragraph
on
wp
indicating
that
it
indeed
represented
the
no
longer
present
vowel
in
those
participles
avi
the
pirah
language
has
rules
of
empirical
evidence
built
into
it
dan
thats
right
every
verb
ends
with
a
suffix
that
tells
you
whether
what
youre
saying
was
directly
observed
or
inferred
or
just
overheard
by
hearsay
so
they
dont
talk
about
things
that
they
havent
witnessed
themselves
or
that
somebody
they
know
hasnt
witnessed
they
dont
have
stories
of
the
ancient
past
because
that
doesnt
make
any
sense
to
them
you
were
never
there
just
for
the
record
there
are
other
languages
which
grammatically
encode
evidentiality
the
source
of
the
information
being
conveyed
the
rules
of
empirical
evidence
built
in
which
do
have
rich
narrative
traditions
including
stories
about
the
past
as
well
as
stories
of
fiction
theres
frequently
either
a
narrative
evidential
marker
or
they
use
the
weakest
hearsay
marker
avi
so
the
pirah
have
made
a
cultural
choice
to
live
in
the
present
and
it
shapes
their
language
dan
thats
right
theyve
made
a
choice
so
for
example
everything
that
pirah
say
has
to
come
with
a
marker
for
where
they
got
the
evidence
and
that
is
why
their
grammar
is
radically
different
from
the
grammars
of
many
other
languages
because
the
taboos
on
talking
about
things
for
which
you
dont
have
evidence
for
have
profound
impact
on
the
actual
structure
of
the
language
again
worth
distinguishing
the
linguistic
feature
from
the
cultural
one
a
language
can
grammatically
encode
evidentiality
without
needing
to
have
a
cultural
taboo
against
speculation
which
is
taboo
in
many
cultures
which
dont
speak
languages
which
grammatically
encode
evidentialityunless
theyre
in
politics
but
the
minute
i
say
john
said
that
peter
hit
bill
all
i
can
tell
is
the
evidence
for
john
said
i
cant
tell
about
the
evidence
where
peter
hit
bill
each
verb
has
to
be
separate
and
have
its
own
evidence
expressed
for
it
when
we
utter
a
simple
sentence
every
part
of
it
is
new
information
john
hit
bill
im
telling
you
that
something
happened
if
i
say
on
the
other
hand
the
man
who
you
saw
yesterday
hit
bill
the
who
you
saw
yesterday
is
old
information
thats
why
we
put
it
in
there
so
we
can
keep
track
of
things
and
thats
a
recursive
structure
but
it
violates
the
fact
that
its
not
an
assertion
its
not
new
information
theres
a
part
of
that
thats
old
information
so
as
long
as
you
say
that
each
sentence
has
to
carry
only
new
information
and
we
have
to
know
the
source
of
the
evidence
there
can
be
no
recursion
in
the
language
so
theres
no
grammaticallymarked
sentence
embedding
with
complementizers
and
the
normal
rigmarole
we
see
many
languages
do
okay
im
not
even
touching
the
use
of
the
word
recursion
here
but
then
this
has
to
do
more
with
the
only
new
information
constraint
than
with
marking
evidentiality
one
could
easily
imagine
a
discourse
in
which
both
the
embedded
and
matrix
clauses
of
john
said
that
peter
hit
bill
carry
entirely
new
information
and
again
there
are
lots
of
languages
which
grammatically
encode
evidentiality
which
do
have
grammatically
marked
sentence
embedding
so
obviously
its
not
evidentiality
which
is
prohibiting
piraha
from
doing
so
the
bill
the
response
in
the
audience
shows
you
just
how
important
these
bills
are
as
a
counter
to
ul33tsass
comment
id
remark
that
linguistics
is
not
a
predictive
science
there
is
no
telling
how
much
any
language
including
english
will
change
over
a
given
200year
period
yes
writing
does
tend
to
be
more
conservative
but
we
never
know
when
a
movement
to
reform
orthography
will
pick
up
steam
nor
whether
there
will
be
a
movement
to
start
reflecting
spoken
discourse
more
faithfully
the
ability
to
read
old
writing
is
also
correlated
with
the
habit
of
reading
old
writing
and
writing
that
is
similar
to
old
writing
this
is
to
say
nothing
of
understanding
speech
which
is
far
more
volatile
and
varied
i
found
a
list
of
languages
and
their
degrees
of
separation
from
latin
is
there
a
similar
list
about
the
degree
of
separation
from
protoindoeuropean
incomplete
as
in
a
historical
sound
change
that
didnt
happen
in
every
variety
of
english
or
incomplete
as
in
a
phonological
rule
that
doesnt
apply
categorically
if
you
mean
the
first
i
dont
think
the
ng
sound
change
was
incomplete
and
if
you
mean
the
second
although
some
phonologists
have
suggested
that
english
derives
from
underlying
ng
i
dont
think
many
phonologists
strongly
believe
that
nowadays
i
could
be
wrong
so
there
wouldnt
be
any
coalescence
going
on
there
to
incompletely
apply
survivor
in
esperanto
theres
the
same
distinction
too
probably
from
slavic
influence
on
the
part
of
its
inventor
if
you
say
li
amas
sian
edzinon
that
means
he
loves
his
wife
in
the
normal
english
sense
si
being
the
reflexive
pronoun
the
a
is
posessive
and
the
n
makes
it
accusative
to
agree
with
edzinon
the
posessive
of
li
he
would
be
lia
but
if
you
say
li
amas
lian
edzinon
it
means
he
loves
his
someone
elses
wife
is
this
practice
still
holding
strong
more
information
is
conveyed
in
a
simple
whatsapp
message
than
in
a
series
of
wistles
the
spread
of
cellphones
is
causing
villagers
to
abandon
it
why
which
produce
sound
last
time
i
checked
id
heard
a
rumor
that
someone
had
mentioned
a
language
other
than
english
in
an
otherwise
gl
paper
and
had
to
see
for
myself
